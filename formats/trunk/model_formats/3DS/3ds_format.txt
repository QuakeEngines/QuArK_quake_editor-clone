Autodesk 3D-Studio File Format (.3ds)
 
Document Revision 0.91 - June 1996
 
Rewritten by Martin van Velsen (email: vvelsen@ronix.ptf.hro.nl )
and Robin Fercoq ( 3ds-bin + mli )(email: robin@msrwww.fc-net.fr)
Based on Original document by Jim Pitts ( email: jp5.ukc.ac.uk )
 
A lot of the chunks are still undocumented.  If you know what they do
please email me Martin van Velsen,Robin Feroq or Jimm Pitts.
As I get more information of the file format,I will document it for
everyone to see.  I will post this regurlarly to alt.3d and alt.3d-studio
and I can be contacted there if my email does not work.
 
This document describes 3ds files produced by version 3.0 and higher of 
3d-studio.  You can find this information at byte 29 in the binary file.
 
This document can be found on the regular newsgroups:
  alt.3d and alt.3d-studio
It can also be found at:
  "http://www.ptf.hro.nl/odi/free-d/docs/io/3ds/3ds_bin.doc"
Or
  "http://www.mediatel.lu"
 
The 3ds file format is made up of chunks. They describe what information
is to follow and what it is made up of, its ID and the location of the
next block.  If you don't understand a chunk, you can quite simply skip it.
The next chunk pointer is relative to the start of the current chunk and
in bytes.  The binary information in the 3ds file is written in a special
kind of way.  Namely the least significant byte comes first in an int.
For example: 4A 5C  (2 bytes in hex) would be 5C high byte and 4A low byte. 
In a long it is: 4A 5C 3B 8F where 5C4A is the low word and 8F 3B is the 
high word.  And now for the chunks. A chunk is defined as:
 
  start end  size   name
  byte  byte bytes

    0    1   2      Chunk ID

    2    5   4      Pointer to next chunk relative to the place where
                    Chunk ID is, in other words the length of the chunk
                    in bytes.
 
Chunks have a hierarchy imposed on them that is identified by its ID.
A 3ds file has the Primary chunk ID 4D4Dh.  This is always the first
chunk of the file.  Within the primary chunk are the main chunks.
 
To give you a preview and a reference to the hierarchy of chunks, below is
a diagram to show the diffrent chunk ID's and their place in the file.
The chunks are given a name because below the diagram is a list which
defines the names to the actual chunk ID's. This makes it easier to
put it in some source code ( how convenient that some sample code is
included )

A chunk type which you can find all through the file are the color chunks
which are called:

  HEX   Mnemonic
 
  0010  COL_RGB
  0011  COL_TRU
  0013  COL_UNK
 
Now for the actual numbers. Be carefull however because there
are a lot of new chunk types which were not documented in the original paper
by Jim Pitts.

Now we give more detailed information about some of the chunks.
 
 * Main chunks
 
   id
 
  3D3D Start of Editor data  ( this is also the place where the objects are )
  B000 Start of Keyframer data
 
  Directly after a Main chunk is another chunk. This could be any other type
  of chunk allowable within its main chunks scope. ( see diagram )
 
 * Subchunks of 3D3D
  id   Description
 0100  Part of configuration
 1100  unknown
 1200  Background Color
 1201  unknown
 1300  unknown
 1400  unknown
 1420  unknown
 1450  unknown
 1500  unknown
 2100  Ambient Color Block
 2200  fog ?
 2201  fog ?
 2210  fog ?
 2300  unknown
 3000  unknown
 3D3E  Editor configuration main block
 4000  Definition of an Object
 AFFF  Start of material list
 
 * Subchunks of AFFF - Start of material list
 
 - Not much is known as of yet, only one chunk can be defined
 
   id      Description
 A000    Materials name
 A010    unknown
 A020    unknown
 A030    unknown
 A040    unknown
 A041    unknown
 A050    unknown
 A052    unknown
 A053    unknown
 A100    unknown
 A084    unknown
 A087    unknown
 
 * A000 - material name
 
 - This chunk contains the name of the material which is an ASCIIZ string
 
 * Subchunks of 3D3E - Editor configuration
 
  id   Description
 7001  Start of viewport indicator
 7011  Viewport definition ( type 2 )
 7012  Viewport definition ( type 1 )
 7020  Viewport definition ( type 3 )
 
The 3D3E chunk is a curious one because it contains a lot of redundant
data. ( or so it seems ) The most important chunk is 7020. this chunk
describes the 4 viewports wich are active in the editor. I assume that
you are using the 4 normal viewport layout, because I have not tested it
with other configurations. The editor confid will contain 5x chunk 7020
and 5x chunk 7011. only the first 4 7020 chunks are important for how
the viewports look like. I guess that the other chunks only give additional
info, but I am not sure. The things you are looking for in these chunks is
at byte: 6 & 7 ( as offset from the first 6 bytes chunk header and pointer )
these bytes ( unsigned int ) contain the info at to what view is used, with
the following id's:
 
  id    Description
 0001   Top
 0002   Bottom
 0003   Left
 0004   Right
 0005   Front
 0006   Back
 0007   User
 FFFF   Camera
 0009   Light
 0010   Disabled
 
 * Subchunks of 4000 - Object description Block
 
 - first item of Subchunk 4000 is an ASCIIZ string of the objects name.
   ASCIIZ means a string of charakters ended by a zero.
 
 Remember an Object can be a Camera a Light or a mesh.

  id      Description
 4010     unknown
 4012     shadow ?
 4100     Triangular Polygon List ( Contains only subchunks )
 4600     Light
 4700     Camera
 
 ( Mapping:
 
   These chunks are optional. They stand just after the vertex list when
   the object is mapped. )
 
 * Subchunks of 4100 - Triangular Polygon List
 
  id      Description
 4110     Vertex List
 4111     Vertex Options
 4120     Face List
 4130     Face Material
 4140     Mapping Coordinates
 4150     Face smoothing group
 4160     Translation Matrix
 4165     Object visible/invisble
 4170     Standard Mapping
 
 * 4110 - Vertex List
 
   start end size type          name
   0     1    2   unsigned int  Total vertices in object
   2     5    4   float         X-value
   6     9    4   float         Y-value
  10    13    4   float         Z-value
 
 bytes 2..13 are repeated times the total amount of vertices in the object
 
 * 4111 - Vertex Options
 
 First 2 bytes: number of vertices.
 
 Then a short int for each vertex:
 
 bit 0-7    0
 bit 8-10   x
 bit 11-12  0
 bit 13   vertex selected in selection 3
 bit 14   vertex selected in selection 2
 bit 15   vertex selected in selection 1
 
 bit 8-10 are just like random. From a save to another of the same scene
 it may change.
 
 Other bits (0-7 and 11-12) have effects on visibility of vertex.
 
 The 4111 chunk can be deleted without much influence, 3ds will still load
 the file all right.
 
 
 * 4120 - Face list
 
 start end size type          name
 0     1    2   unsigned int  total polygons in object (numpoly)
 
 2     3    2   unsigned int  number of vertex A
 4     5    2   unsigned int  number of vertex B
 6     7    2   unsigned int  number of vertex C
 8     9    2   unsigned int  face info (*)
 
 repeats 'numpoly' times for each polygon.
 
The first three ints are the three vertices of the face.
0 stands for the first vertex defined in the vertex list.
The order has a purpose: to give the direction for the normal of each face.
If you turn a screw (standard screw) in the way the vertices
indicate you will find the normal.
If vertices given in order are A B C:
 
               C
               ^
               |
        A----->B
 
This means unscrewing => the normal points out of the screen.
 
 (*) this number is is a binary number which expands to 3 values.
     for example 0x0006 would expand to 110 binary. The value should be
     read as 1 1 0 .This value can be found in 3d-studio ascii files as
     AB:1 BC:1 AC:0 .Which probably indicated the order of the vertices.
     For example AB:1 would be a normal line from A to B. But AB:0 would
     mean a line from B to A.
 
     bit 0       AC visibility
     bit 1       BC visibility
     bit 2       AB visibility
     bit 3       Mapping (if there is mapping for this face)
     bit 4-8   0 (not used ?)
     bit 9-10  x (chaotic ???)
     bit 11-12 0 (not used ?)
     bit 13      face selected in selection 3
     bit 14      face selected in selection 2
     bit 15      face selected in selection 1
 
 * 4130 - Face Material Chunk
 
   If the object is all default material there is no 4130 chunk.
   In fact, there is one 4130 chunk for each material present on the object.
 
   Each 4130 face material chunks begins with an asciiz of a material,
   then after the null character is a short int that gives the number
   of faces of the object concerned by this material, then there is the
   list itself of these faces. 0000 means the first face of the (4120)
   face list.
 
   ************ Read the Doc on MLI files for more info on **************
   ************ Mapping and Materials                      **************
 
 * 4140 Mapping coordinates.
 
   First 2 bytes: number of vertices.
 
   Then, for each vertex 2 floats that give the mapping coordinates.
   That is, if a point is at the center of the map it will have 0.5 0.5
   as mapping coordinates.
 
 * 4150 - Face Smoothing Group
 
   nfaces*4bytes
 
   If read as long int, the nth bit indicate if the face belongs or not
   to the nth smoothing group.
 
 * 4160 Local axis
 
   Local axis info.
   The three first blocks of three floats are the definition
   (in the absolute axis) of the local axis X Y Z of the object.
   And the last block of three floats is the local center of the object.
 
 
 * 4170 Standard mapping
 
   First 2 bytes: type of mapping
   0 => plannar or specific (in this case, like mapping from the lofter,
                            the information of this chunk is irrelevant)
   1 => cylindrical
   2 => spherical
 
   then come 21 floats that describe the mapping.

   start end size type   name
   0      3    4  float  Light pos X
   4      7    4  float  Light pos Y
   8     11    4  float  Light pos Z
 
   after this structure check for more chunks.

 The object hierarchy is a bit complex but works like this.
 Each Object in the scene is given a number to identify its
 order in the tree. Also each object is orddered in the 3ds
 file as it would appear in the tree.
 The root object is given the number -1 ( FFFF ).
 As the file is read a counter of the object number is kept.
 Is the counter increments the object are children of the
 previous objects.But when the pattern is broken by a number
 what will be less than the current counter the hierarchy returns
 to that level.
 
 for example.

 Still not done with this chunk yet !
 If the object name is $$$DUMMY then it is a dummy object
 and therefore you should expect a few extra chunks.
 
 * B011 - Dummy objects name.
 
    Names a dummy object. ASCIIZ string.
 
 * B020 - Pivot Point ?
 
 The Objects pivot point. Not quite sure what the first five floats do yet
 ( ideas ?).
