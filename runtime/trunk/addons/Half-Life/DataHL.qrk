//               the correct 'liblist.gam' file contents. In this DataHL.QRK, search for "liblist.gam" and comment out those lines

//
// 1999-02-20   Removed some unneeded/duplicated specifics from trigger_monsterjump, trigger_cdaudio and monster_generic
//              Discovered that scripted_sequences' m_iszEntity specific, can also take classnames so the nearest entity of that
//               type will start doing the sequence. (Look at T0A0D.BSP's door lock and Barneys.)
//
// 1999-02-14   Added angle to func_water (Thanks to Patrick Steele)
//              A 'ÿ' character unfortunatly caused the t_triggerpoly and t_originpoly to be invalid, now fixed (Thanks to Patrick Steele
//              for notice that)
//

//              Set default framerate of env_sprite to 10 (Thanks to Patrick Steele)
//
// 1999-02-03   Started adding model sequences...
//              Removed obsolete spawnflags from aiscripted_sequence and scripted_sequence (Thanks to Patrick Steele)
//
// 1999-01-22   Searched HL.DLL and found things I added; monster_bloater, monster_flyer, weapon_glock, weapon_mp5, weapon_python,
//               ammo_glockclip, ammo_mp5clip and ammo_mp5grenades. Inserted but not visible; item_sodacan, env_smoker, env_debris
//               and env_lighting. If you know what specifics are used in these last four objects, please tell me at decker@post1.tele.dk
//              Renamed func_healthcharge to func_healthcharger (That was why it didn't work!)
//              Added a default of health=5 (Volume) to ambient_generic (Thanks to Patrick Steele for the suggestion)
//
// 1999-01-15   Added t_rendermode to t_door (Thanks to Patrick Steele)
//
// 1999-01-14   Note: Must try to rearrange those textures in a better way...
//              Changed Vehicles-texture group to a .qtxfolder
//              Changed all texture-dir/file references to :incl style
//              Sorted textures which was prefixed with + or - so its the correct first-one thats put on brushes (Thanks to Patrick Steele)
//
// 1999-01-11   Added ammo_9mmbox, monster_rat, monster_snark, monster_babycrap
//
// 1999-01-09   Added 'targetname' to func_breakable (Dohh!)
//              Added message names from TITLES.TXT to env_message
//              Added an ORIGIN brush to func_tracktrain, func_trackautochange and func_trackchange
//
// 1999-01-08   Figured out what a "sentence-group" was, so added it to the speaker entity
//              Added 'angle' to func_conveyor, func_button and momentary_door
//              Added a 'spawnflags' to func_guntarget
//              Change brush-texture to AAATRIGGER for func_tankcontrols, func_traincontrols, func_monster_clip and func_mortar_field
//              Added 'angle' and change brush-texture to AAATRIGGER for env_bubbles
//              Removed spaces between "specific" and ": =". Eq: "radius : = " to "radius: = "
//
// 1999-01-07   Added 'targetname' to trigger_relay (Dohh!)
//              Added 'targetname' to door entities, so they can be triggered by other entities
//
// 1999-01-06   Changed texture of func_ladder to AAATRIGGER, since you never see it anyway
//              Changed the default brush of func_pendulum, to include an ORIGIN brush also
//              Notice also in stalkyard.bsp, that the weapon_crossbow has a specific 'sequence', so I added it
//              Changed the default brush of func_tank* entities, to include an ORIGIN brush also
//              Added 'angle' to func_tank* entities, since it controls the start direction
//              Added func_tankcontrols, as I found it in stalkyard.bsp's Gun-Turret
//
// 1999-01-05   Added a brush with the ORIGIN texture to 'rotating' entities which indicate the origin of the rotation (unfortunately
//               this makes the other brush's size defaulted to 64x64x64)
//              Changed the brush of trigger_* entities to use the texture AAATRIGGER (and unfortunately a default size of 64x64x64)
//              Moved Xeno-textures folder under the HalfLife-textures folder, since there are duplicates of
//               AAATRIGGER, BLACK, ORIGIN and CLIP textures in both WAD files (HALFLIFE.WAD and XENO.WAD)
//
// 1999-01-02   Added 'globalname' to func_pushable
//              Prefixed all sentence-lists with an !, since without HL.EXE thinks its a "sentence-group"
//              Added 'targetname' to scripted_sequence, aiscripted_sequence and scripted_sentence
//              Added 'angle' to func_door
//              Added more specifics to weaponbox, even ones that contain spaces which can't be typed in the map-editor
//              Started history
