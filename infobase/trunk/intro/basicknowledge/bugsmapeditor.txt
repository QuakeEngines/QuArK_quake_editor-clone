title: Bugs or unexpected behavior in the map editor
author: Armin Rigo / Decker, DanielPharos

An unexpected behavior is a QuArK bug unless it enters the category of <ref> ./compilingmaps </ref>.
A typical bug comes as an error message with a button "More>>" that will let you copy and paste a detailled bug report.
Then send the bug to
<link forums>the QuArK-forum</link>, including the bug report and what you were doing
when the bug occurred. If the bug can be reproduced, please give a step-by-step procedure to follow to reproduce it.

In the recent versions of QuArK 5 and 6, there are some known problems; please don't report them. These include troubles with
the 3D viewers on some 3DFX graphic cards. A description of these troubles and proposed solutions are discussed in the
<link forums>forum</link>.
Cdunde also writes news about important bug fixes and workarounds on the
<link news>news page</link> of the web site.

Here is one of the most common known bugs (please don't report it again, we're working on it!): I've heard that QuArK
often has troubles with the most recent Glide drivers. Try using older drivers. Find an old driver, get its file "GLIDE2X.DLL",
and put it into the QuArK directory. Doing it this way won't prevent other programs and games to use the already-installed
recent drivers; only QuArK will use the old ones.
