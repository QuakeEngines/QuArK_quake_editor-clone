title: Helping in QuArK's development (adding games, features...)
author: Armin Rigo, Decker, tiglari

If you want to help with QuArK's development, here is how you can do various things. You don't have to be a programmer to
give some help! If you need help about these ways of helping, see the
<link forums>QuArK forum</link> on the web site.

<ul>
<li><strong>Testing</strong>:<br>
   QuArK's development team is rather small, and have other responsibilities
   to attend to, so systematic testing of new features by users can be quite
   helpful, and of course requires no knowledge of programming, only mapping
   (and is not at all a trivial thing to do, and can be quite time-consuming).
   In the same vein, intelligent comparisons of QuArK's features with those
   of other editors can be quite useful; it may or may not be easy or even
   possible to implement your favorite feature from Editor X, but if we know
   about it, we can at least think about trying.

<li><strong>Support for a mod</strong>:<br>
  If you want to write support for a game mod (e.g. a Mission Pack or any smaller mod), you have to write a small
  add-on file which lists the new entities available and their attributes, as well as the new textures, if any. This
  process is relatively easy. Try opening with any text editor one of the add-on files included in the QuArK
  distribution, e.g. "CTFq2.qrk" (Capture-The-Flag for Quake 2.) This is the kind of file you have to write. This is
  described in detail in <ref> adv </ref>.

<li><strong>Fixes and enhancements in the existing game data</strong>:<br>
  If you want to enhance the existing game-specific data (e.g. the entity lists, the available entity settings, and
  on-line help for all this), you can do so by editing the files "DataXXX.qrk" -- "DataQ1.qrk" for Quake 1,
  "DataQ2.qrk" for Quake 2, etc. The format of these files is the same as for the add-ons for the support of a mod,
  with a single difference: For performance, these large files are not directly editable with a text editor; instead,
  they are stored in a binary format. You can get the original full-text files from <ref> src/sf </ref>
  in the directory <a target="_blank" href="http://quark.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/quark/runtime/addons/">runtime/addons</a>.

<li><strong>A Python plug-in</strong>:<br>
  A large part of the map editor is written in a scripting language called Python.
  This code is distributed with QuArK -- you already have it in the <tt>.PY</tt> files
  of the directories "quarkpy" and "plugins". If you want to program an enhancement to
  the map editor, you can probably do it in Python, just by modifying these files or
  adding a new file in "plugins". No other tool is needed.  For a first project, a
  new plugin is best; it can be uploaded for testing to the files section of the quark
  or quark-python egroups, and if it is generally accepted as useful, somebody can commit
  it to the main code body at SourceForge. Plugins will usually work with quite a wide
  range of QuArK versions, so that people don't have to have the latest bleeding edge
  snapshot to test them, and if a plugin causes a problem, this problem can be fixed
  by deleting the plugin's <tt>.PY</tt> and <tt>.PYC</tt> files.

  More ambitious projects might involve changes to the quarkpy
  Python modules, or even the Delphi source code, but it's best to do a simple
  plugin first.  For more information about Python, you can refer to the
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org">Python home page</a>, and for Python in the
  context of QuArK, <ref> adv </ref>.

<li><strong>Direct changes in the source code</strong>:<br>
  The source code of QuArK is freely available, by various forms of access from
  <link project>project QuArK</link> on SourceForge (anonymous
  CVS/WinCVS is probably the most convenient, once you can get it working).

  The main programming language is Borland Delphi, either 5 or 6 will do.  Personal Version 6
  is quite adequate, and is available as a free download from
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.borland.com">Borland</a>.  If you want to program a new interface feature (such as
  a dialog box to hunt for things in the map having some properties, or maybe a new map layout
  such as perhaps something that works like the XY view in Radiant, with the vertical Z window,
  etc.), most or very likely all of the coding would be in Python.  Reading and
  writing map or model formats for new
  games on the other hand will typically involve some Delphi coding.
</ul>

As stated above, you can find more help about this subject in the
<link forums>QuArK forum</link> on the web site.

The <ref>src</ref> section of the infobase is gradually coming to contain more information
about how the Delphi code works and how it relates to the Python.
