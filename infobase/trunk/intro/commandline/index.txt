title: Commandline of QuArK

The commandline of QuArK allows you to send some additional information to QuArK as it starts up.  There aren't many options, since most can be set using environmental variables <ref> src/topics/logging </ref> (for logging only) or in the Configuration menu.

Recognized parameters:<br>
/?: Displays a window containing this information.<br>
/NOINSTANCE: Skips the single-instance check (use at own risk!)<br>
/NOSPLASH: Skips the splash screen.  This will improve start-up time.<br>
/NOUPDATE: Skips the update check.  This will prevent QuArK from checking for updates.

Note: All other parameters will be interpreted as files to load.

For those not familiar how to use commandlines: the parameters can be added to a shortcut:<br>
Right-click the QuArK shortcut > Properties > Target: Add the parameters to the end of the Target, separated by spaces.  If a parameters contains a space, put double-quotes around it.<br>
You can also use a DOS-prompt to accomplish this.  Simply append the parameters to the QuArK.exe-command the same way as with the shortcut.
