Picking up from where we left off from above, these are the <g>RMB</g> menus available in the
Skin-view that can assist you in multi and single vertex movement and <g>realignment</g>.
All of these functions work in conjunction with the <g>Vertex drag mode</g> button which is
shown set to the <g>Single drag mode</g> in the screen shot to the right.

Basically, these functions all center around <g>snapping</g> one or more <g>Picked</g> vertexes,
shown here as blue handles, to a <g>Base</g> location, shown to the right as lime green.
These colors are changeable by selection from the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#coloroptions">Model Editors Colors Configuration</a>
section. The <g>Base Vertex</g> uses the same color setting as the <g>Selected brushes, side view</g>
and the <g>Skin Vertexes</g> use the same color as the <g>3D views drag lines</g> setting.

The procedure is simple, first select a <g>Base Vertex</g> by placing your cursor over the one
you wish to choose, then <g>RMB</g> click and select <g>Pick Base Vertex</g> (not shown here but it's
at the top off the menu where it displays <g>Change Base Vertex</g> now).

Second, do the same for each skin vertex choosing the <g>Pick Skin Vertex</g> menu item each time.

Finally, when you are ready to make your <g>snap</g> either place your cursor over any of the selected
skin vertexes or anywhere in the Skin-view, <g>RMB</g> click and select <g>Align skin vertexes</g>.

The snap will take place and the final results will look something like the second image of the eye
at the bottom of the screen shot. Now a couple of special situations in using these menu functions.

If you are only going to snap one <g>Skin Vertex</g> to the <g>Base Vertex</g> then all you need to do
is select that <g>Base Vertex</g> and the <g>Align skin vertexes</g> menu items following the steps above.
You do not need to use the <g>Pick Skin Vertex</g> menu item. In addition, the <g>Base Vertex</g> will
remain selected for you, so you can simply <g>RMB</g> click over another skin vertex to move it to the
same position <b>or</b> you can place your cursor over any unselected vertex and choose the
<g>Change Base Vertex</g> menu item and it will jump to that new location and you can carry on from there.

Using these along with the <g>Vertex drag mode</g> button a number of various combinations of aligning
vertexes can be accomplished. And as stated in the section above, the exact co-ordnances
,of all of these items, will be displayed in the editor's, lower left corner,
Help box as you proceed through the phases of your editing.

<i>Clear Skin Pick list </i>&nbsp;: This will do just that, clear all of the <g>picked</g> vertexes including
the <g>Base vertex</g> and start fresh.

<i>Force to grid </i>&nbsp;: When the <g>Skin Grid is Active</g> (see menu item below) in the <g>Skin-view</g>
this allows you to <g>snap</g> a vertex, or group of vertexes, to the closest grid point position. These grid
points can be changed by using the grid settings covered above.

<i><b>Vertex Commands</b> - submenu items </i>&nbsp;:

<i>Clear Skin Pick list </i>&nbsp;: Described above.

<i>Align skin vertexes </i>&nbsp;: Also described above.

<i><b>Skin-view Options</b> - submenu items </i>&nbsp;: (also located on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#optionsmenu">Options menu</a>)<br>

<i>Sync Editor views with Skin-view </i>&nbsp;: This function will turn off other related options and synchronize selected
<g>Skin-view mesh vertexes</g>, passing and selecting the coordinated <g>Model mesh vertexes</g> in the Editors views,
where they can be used for editing purposes. Any selection changes in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>
will be updated to the Editors views as well. Once the selection has been passed, if this function is turned off,
the selection will remain in both the Editor and the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>
for further use. The <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> and Editor views selected vertex colors can
be changed in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#coloroptions">Colors Options</a> settings.

<i>Pass selection to Editor views </i>&nbsp;: This function will pass selected <g>Skin-view mesh vertexes</g> and select
the coordinated <g>Model mesh vertexes</g> in the Editors views, along with any others currently selected, where they can
be used for editing purposes. Once the selection has been passed, if this function is turned off, the selection will remain
in the Editor for its use there. The <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> selected vertex colors can be
changed in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#coloroptions">Colors Options</a> settings.

<i>Clear Selected Faces </i>&nbsp;: This function will clear all faces in the Skin-view that have been drawn as 'Selected'
or 'Show' but any related selected vertexes will remain that way for editing purposes. The 'Skin-view' selected face,
show face and selected vertex colors can be changed in the 'Configuration Model Colors' section.

<i>Skin From 3D view </i>&nbsp;: This turns the function on or off to take co-ordnances for the 'Skin-view' from the
editors 3D view when new objects are created using the 'Quick Object Maker'. It will place that object on the skin exactly
the same way you see it in the 3D view when the object is created. This same process applies to selected faces in the editor.
Because the 3D view uses its own 'scale' factor, activating this function will also turn off the <g>Use Skin-view scale</g> function.

<i>Use Skin-view scale </i>&nbsp;: This turns the function on or off for applying of the views 'zoom' or 'scale' factor when
taking co-ordnances from the 'Skin-view' and which works in reverse. Meaning, when this option is checked,
if the Skin-view is zoomed out (skin looks small) it will skin new triangles with fewer repetitions (skin looks larger)
of that image and visa-versa. Because the 3D view uses its own 'scale' factor, activating this function will also turn
off the <g>Skin From 3D view</g> function.

<i>Skin Grid Visible </i>&nbsp;: (Also located in the Model Editor Configuration Options section) This function gives
quick access to turn the Skin-view Grid on and off, but it will still be active for functions that use it such as
the <g>snap to</g> function.

<i>Skin Grid Active </i>&nbsp;: (Also located in the Model Editor Configuration Options section) This function also gives
quick access to activate or deactivate the Skin-view Grid. But any functions that use it such as the <g>snap to</g> function
will not be effective.

<i>Single Sel Drag Lines </i>&nbsp;: This function stops the multiple selection drag lines of the 'Linear Handle' from
being drawn in the Skin-view to speed up the Skin-view selection and handle creation.

And Two more additional RMB items are located on the <g>Draw Ticks During Drag</g> sub-menu. These are:

<i><b>Draw Ticks During Drag:</b> - submenu items </i>&nbsp;: These functions give various methods for drawing the Models
Skin Mesh Vertex Ticks while doing a <g>rectangle drag</g>.<br>

<i>Rectangle drag-method 1 </i>&nbsp;: This function will draw the Skin-view mesh vertex 'Ticks' during a rectangle drag
with a minimum amount of flickering, but is a slower drawing method.

<i>Rectangle drag-method 2 </i>&nbsp;: This function will draw the Skin-view mesh vertex 'Ticks', using the fastest method,
during a rectangle drag, but will cause the greatest amount of flickering.
