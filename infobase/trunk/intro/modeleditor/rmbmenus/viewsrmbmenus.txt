<i>Undo </i>&nbsp;: This will display the last Undo\Redo action item that has taken place if any.

<img border=1 align=right usemap="#rmbmenusMap0">viewsrmbmenus1.png</img>

<i>Paste here </i>&nbsp;: This is a simple paste command to drop something you have copied into
one of the editors views if it can be.

<i>BBox Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the BBox Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it and are covered in detail below.

<i>Tag Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Tag Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it and are covered in detail below.

<i>Bone Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Bone Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it. To activate this menu item you must have the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html">Linear Drag Handles</a> button
de-activated (in vertex mode) and select either the <g>Skeleton</g> folder or a model component's <g>Frames</g> folder
or at least one frame or bone within one of those folders, then this menu item will activate.
Individual items will become active on its sub-menu depending on your selections and cursor placement over a bone handle.
These are strictly bone related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Face Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Face Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it. To implement this menu you must have the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html">Linear Drag Handles</a> button
activated (in face mode) and select at least one face in a model component, then this menu
item will appear. These are strictly face (triangle) related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Vertex Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Vertex Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it. To activate this menu item you must have the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html">Linear Drag Handles</a> button
de-activated (in vertex mode) and select at least one frame in a model component's <g>Frames</g> folder,
then this menu item will activate. These are strictly vertex related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Search </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Search sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it and are covered in detail below.

<i>Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it. These are the same commands located on the 'Commands' menu of the Main
menu bar and are more Triangle related. These are also covered in detail below.

<i>Keyframe Commands </i>&nbsp;: Keyframe functions create additional animation frames for movement
between two selected frames.<br>
The number of additional frames to be created is the amount set on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.animation.html#__top__">Animation toolbar</a>
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.animation.html#ipf">IPF button</a> <b>- 1</b>.<br>
For example, if you want <b>3</b> fill frames added between the two selected keyframes,
set the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.animation.html#ipf">IPF button</a> to <b>4</b>.
To use these functions you must select two frames of the same component.
If they are not consecutive frames (one right after the other) then all frames in between the
two will be replaced with the newly created frames.
You can also select other components for their same frames to be included.
If a component has <a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#tags">Tags</a>,
such as imported <g>.md3</g> Quake3 models, all of its <b>related</b> imported components and
their tags will also be included without having to select them. But not all of the components
of that particular <g>.md3</g> model that were imported separately. So be sure to select
those components also if you want them included.
They are strictly frame and component related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Bone Options </i>&nbsp;: These functions deal with the Model Bone visual tools to work with.
They are strictly bone related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Editor Face Options </i>&nbsp;: These functions deal with the Model Mesh selection methods
available and various visual tools to work with. They are strictly face related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Editor Vertex Options </i>&nbsp;: These functions deal with the Model Mesh selection methods
available and various visual tools to work with. They are strictly vertex related and are covered in detail below.

<a name="autoframerenaming"></a>
<i>Auto Frame Renaming </i>&nbsp;:Some models consist of more then one component. If so, their frame names
should always match. When checked, if a frame of one component is renamed, this will cause the same frame
of all the other related components to be renamed also automatically.

<a name="reset3dview"></a>
<i>Reset 3D view </i>&nbsp;: If the model becomes 'lost', goes out of the 3D view, you can use this
function to reset the 3D view and bring the model back to its starting position when it was first opened
and based on the 'Rotation Method' you last chose to rotate the model by.

<a name="boundingboxes"></a>
<i>Draw Bounding Boxes </i>&nbsp;: When checked this activates the display of model bounding boxes if any.
Also known as <g>hit boxes</g> for Half-Life and by other names for different model formats.

<a name="componentcolors"></a>
<i>Use Component Colors </i>&nbsp;: When checked this activates the display of individual component colors,
which can be set on the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">Specifics page</a>,
to distinguish one model component mesh area from another.

<a name="viewsettings"></a>
<u>Each view can be set to one of three rendering modes :</u>

<i>Wireframe </i>&nbsp;: The model mesh will be drawn as lines.
This is the fastest drawing-method of the model-views. 

<i>Solid </i>&nbsp;: Each model is drawn in a single, solid color or shades of that color.
This means that you won't be able to 'see-through' the model once it is in view.

<i>Textured </i>&nbsp;: The model is displayed with its full texture applied for the finished "skinned" look.

<a name="backgroundimage"></a>
<i>Background image... </i>&nbsp;: When selected, this will open a dialog box where you can choose any image
file the <g>QuArK</g> supports to place and display in the 2D view that the cursor was in when the RMB was clicked.

<i>Assign \ Release BBox </i>&nbsp;: BBox is a polyhedron box that is called by different names and are used for different
things based on a game models format. Commonly it surrounds an area for a 'hitbox', 'collision', 'bounding box'...
When a BBox is selected and a RMB click on the center of a bone is made, then that BBox can be assigned to that bone, or
release from that bone if both have not already been assigned to something else that would cause a conflict.
To properly position the BBox on the bone, use its <g>center handle</g> and drag it to the coords <g>0,0,0</g>
in the editor's views <b>BEFORE</b> you assign it to a bone. Once assigned you can change the BBox size by
dragging its <g>side handles</g>, the <g>corner handles</g> will <b>NOT</b> hold its shape.

<i>Assign \ Release Vertices </i>&nbsp;: When vertices of a component are selected, RMB click on the center of a bone,
then click this item to assign them to, or release them from ,that bone. Combinations of both can be done at the same time.

<i>Set Handle Position </i>&nbsp;: Active when one or more vertexes are selected that are assigned to that bone handle.
Click this item to position and set that bone handle centered within those vertexes.
An 'offset' can also be applied to this setting.

<i>Select (bone handle name) Vertexes </i>&nbsp;: When the cursor is over a bone's Center handle with vertexes assigned to it,
click this item to select all of them from that bone's handle. Or, if another handle is attached that has the vertexes
assigned to it instead, then those are the vertexes that will be selected. If no vertexes have been assigned to any
handle at that location, then the menu item will show disabled.

<i>Select (bone handle name) handle position Vertexes </i>&nbsp;: When the cursor is over a bone's Center handle with vertexes
assigned to it, click this item to select the vertexes used to set that bone's handle position. Or, if another handle is
attached that has the vertexes assigned to it instead, then those are the position vertexes for that handle that will be
selected. If no vertexes have been assigned to any handle at that location, then the menu item will show disabled.

<i>Add \ Remove Control </i>&nbsp;: This will add or remove a single bone controle, connected to the bone handle when the
<g>RMB</g> was clicked in the editor's view.

<a name="bonesselection"></a>
<i>Individual Bones Selection </i>&nbsp;: (Unless a function specifically deals with all bones)
When this item is checked ONLY the INDIVIDUAL bone handles that are selected will be effected
and NOT any sub-bones that are NOT specifically selected, Which IS the case if this is un-checked.

<i>Handle Scaling </i>&nbsp;: These functions deal with setting the scale size of the bone handles for better work size.
These are covered in detail below. Click on this menu item, shown in blue above, to see the sub-menu and its items below.

<i>Show Bones </i>&nbsp;: This allows all bones to be displayed in the editor's views.

<i>Hide Bones </i>&nbsp;: This stops all bones from being displayed in the editor's views.

<i>Structure Bones </i>&nbsp;: When clicked this function will place all bones
inside their 'parent' bones in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a>.

<i>Extract Bones </i>&nbsp;: When clicked this function will move all bones
outside of their 'parent' bones in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a>.

<i>Force to grid </i>&nbsp;: This will cause a bone's center handle to <g>snap</g> to the nearest location on the
editor's grid for the view that the RMB click was made in.

<i>Show selection in Skin-view </i>&nbsp;: Because the Skin-view and the rest of the editor views work independently,
this will pass selected editor model mesh triangle faces to the 'Skin-view' to be outlined and distinguish them. However,
it does not actually select them in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>. Any selections or deselections will
not show in the 'Skin-view' until the mouse buttons have been released. The <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>

<i>No face drag lines </i>&nbsp;: This will stop the selection and drawing of all drag lines when model mesh faces have
been selected which can increase the selection speed of the editor dramatically when a model with a large number of face
triangles is being edited.

<i>No face outlines </i>&nbsp;: This will stop the outlining of any models mesh faces have been selected. This will
increase the drawing speed of the editor dramatically when a model with a large number of face triangles is being edited.
The solid fill of selected faces will still be available.

<i>No face outlines while moving in 2D views </i>&nbsp;: Face outlining can be very taxing on the editors drawing speed
when panning (scrolling) or zooming in the <g>2D views</g> when a lot of the models mesh faces have been selected.
This is because so many views need to be redrawn repeatedly. If you experience this problem check this option to increase
the drawing and movement speed. The lines will be redrawn at the end of the move.

<i>No selection fill </i>&nbsp;: This stops the color filling and backface pattern from being drawn for any of the models
mesh faces that are selected. Only the outline of the selected faces will be drawn. This will not apply for any view that
has its <g>Fill in Mesh</g> function active (checked) in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#viewoptions">Views Options</a> dialog.

<i>Front faces only </i>&nbsp;: This will only allow the solid color filling of the front faces to be drawn for any of the
models mesh faces that are selected. The back faces will be outlined allowing the models texture to be displayed if the
view is in <g>Textured</g> mode. This will not apply for any view that has its <g>Fill in Mesh</g> function active
(checked) in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#viewoptions">Views Options</a> dialog.

<i>Back faces only </i>&nbsp;: This will only allow the drawing of the backface pattern to be drawn for any of the models
mesh faces that are selected. The front faces will be outlined allowing the models texture to be displayed if the view is
in 'Textured' mode. This will not apply for any view that has its <g>Fill in Mesh</g> function active (checked) in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#viewoptions">Views Options</a> dialog.

<i>Sync Skin-view with Editor views </i>&nbsp;: This function will turn off other related options and synchronize selected
Editor views mesh vertexes, passing and selecting the coordinated <g>Skin mesh vertexes</g> in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>,
where they can be used for editing purposes. Any selection changes in the Editor views will be updated to the

turned off, the selection will remain in both the Editor and the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> for further use.

<i>Pass selection to Skin-view </i>&nbsp;: This function will pass selected Editor model mesh vertexes and select the
coordinated <g>Model Skin mesh</g> vertexes in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>,
along with any others currently selected, where they can be used for editing purposes. Once the selection has been passed,
if this function is turned off, the selection will remain in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>
for its use there. The Editor's selected vertex colors can be changed in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#coloroptions">Colors Options</a> settings.

<i>No vertex drag lines </i>&nbsp;: This stops the multi selected Editor model mesh vertexes drag lines from being drawn,
but not the vertex outlines. Single vertex drag lines will also still be drawn.
