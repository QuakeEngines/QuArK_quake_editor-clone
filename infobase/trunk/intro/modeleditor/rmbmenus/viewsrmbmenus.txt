<i>Undo </i>&nbsp;: This will display the last Undo\Redo action item that has taken place if any.

<i>Paste here </i>&nbsp;: This is a simple paste command to drop something you have copied into
one of the editors views if it can be.

<i>Bone Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Bone Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it. To activate this menu item you must have the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html">Linear Drag Handles</a> button
de-activated (in vertex mode) and select either a model component's <g>Frames</g> or <g>Skeleton</g> folder,
or at least one frame or bone within one of those folders, then this menu item will activate.
Individual items will become active on its sub-menu depending on your selections and cursor placement over a bone handle.
These are strictly bone related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Face Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Face Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it. To implement this menu you must have the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html">Linear Drag Handles</a> button
activated (in face mode) and select at least one face in a model component, then this menu
item will appear. These are strictly face (triangle) related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Vertex Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Vertex Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it. To activate this menu item you must have the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html">Linear Drag Handles</a> button
de-activated (in vertex mode) and select at least one frame in a model component's <g>Frames</g> folder,
then this menu item will activate. These are strictly vertex related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it. These are the same commands located on the 'Commands' menu of the Main
menu bar and are more Triangle related. These are also covered in detail below.

<i>Bone Options </i>&nbsp;: These functions deal with the Model Bone visual tools to work with.
They are strictly bone related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Editor Face Options </i>&nbsp;: These functions deal with the Model Mesh selection methods
available and various visual tools to work with. They are strictly face related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Editor Vertex Options </i>&nbsp;: These functions deal with the Model Mesh selection methods
available and various visual tools to work with. They are strictly vertex related and are covered in detail below.

<i>Reset 3D view </i>&nbsp;: If the model becomes 'lost', goes out of the 3D view, you can use this
function to reset the 3D view and bring the model back to its starting position when it was first opened
and based on the 'Rotation Method' you last chose to rotate the model by.

<i>Use Component Colors </i>&nbsp;: When checked this activates the display of individual component colors,
which can be set on the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">Specifics page</a>,
to distinguish one model component mesh area from another.

<u>Each view can be set to one of three rendering modes :</u>

<i>Wireframe </i>&nbsp;: The model mesh will be drawn as lines.
This is the fastest drawing-method of the model-views. 

<i>Solid </i>&nbsp;: Each model is drawn in a single, solid color or shades of that color.
This means that you won't be able to 'see-through' the model once it is in view.

<i>Textured </i>&nbsp;: The model is displayed with its full texture applied for the finished "skinned" look.

<i>Background image... </i>&nbsp;: When selected, this will open a dialog box where you can choose any image
file the <g>QuArK</g> supports to place and display in the 2D view that the cursor was in when the RMB was clicked.
Click <a href="intro.mapeditor.rmb_menus.noselectionmenu.html#background">here</a> for full detailed information

<i>Align Bones Starts </i>&nbsp;: This will attach the second selected bone's start handle to the first selected bone's
start handle of the currently selected model component <g>Skeleton</g> group.
Moving the second bone above the first bone in the <g>tree-view</g> will reverse this movement.

<i>Align Bones Ends </i>&nbsp;: This will align the second selected bone's end handle to first selected bone's end handle,
but not attach them. Moving the second bone above the first bone in the <g>tree-view</g> will reverse this movement.

<i>Assign to Start </i>&nbsp;: When only one bone and vertexes of that component are selected,
click this item to assign them to the <g>start_point</g> of that bone.

<i>Assign to End </i>&nbsp;: When only one bone and vertexes of that component are selected,
and there is no continuing bone, click this item to assign them to the <g>end_point</g> of that bone.

<i>Select (bone handle name) Vertexes </i>&nbsp;: When the cursor is over a bone's Center handle with vertexes assigned to it,
click this item to select all of them from that bone's handle. Or, if another handle is attached that has the vertexes
assigned to it instead, then those are the vertexes that will be selected. If no vertexes have been assigned to any
handle at that location, then the menu item will show disabled.

<i>Select (bone handle name) handle position Vertexes </i>&nbsp;: When the cursor is over a bone's Center handle with vertexes
assigned to it, click this item to select the vertexes used to set that bone's handle position. Or, if another handle is
attached that has the vertexes assigned to it instead, then those are the position vertexes for that handle that will be
selected. If no vertexes have been assigned to any handle at that location, then the menu item will show disabled.

<i>Sync Skin-view with Editor views </i>&nbsp;: When checked this will synchronize the Skin-view with the Editor views
for either of the active selection options below, <g>Show selection in Skin-view</g> and <g>Pass selection to Skin-view</g>.

<i>Show selection in Skin-view </i>&nbsp;: Because the Skin-view and the rest of the editor views work independently,
this will pass selected editor model mesh triangle faces to the 'Skin-view' to be outlined and distinguish them. However,
it does not actually select them in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>. Any selections or deselections will
not show in the 'Skin-view' until the mouse buttons have been released. The <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>
outline color can be changed in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#coloroptions">Colors Options</a> settings.

<i>Pass selection to Skin-view </i>&nbsp;: This function will pass selected editor model mesh triangle faces  and select the
coordinated skin triangles in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> where they can be used for editing purposes.
Once the selection has been passed, if this function is turned off, the selection will remain in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> for its use there. Any selections  or deselections will not show
in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> until the mouse buttons have been released.
The <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> selected face outline color can be changed in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#coloroptions">Colors Options</a> settings.

<i>No face drag lines </i>&nbsp;: This will stop the selection and drawing of all drag lines when model mesh faces have
been selected which can increase the selection speed of the editor dramatically when a model with a large number of face
triangles is being edited.

<i>No face outlines </i>&nbsp;: This will stop the outlining of any models mesh faces have been selected. This will
increase the drawing speed of the editor dramatically when a model with a large number of face triangles is being edited.
The solid fill of selected faces will still be available.

<i>No face outlines while moving in 2D views </i>&nbsp;: Face outlining can be very taxing on the editors drawing speed
when panning (scrolling) or zooming in the <g>2D views</g> when a lot of the models mesh faces have been selected.
This is because so many views need to be redrawn repeatedly. If you experience this problem check this option to increase
the drawing and movement speed. The lines will be redrawn at the end of the move.

<i>No selection fill </i>&nbsp;: This stops the color filling and backface pattern from being drawn for any of the models
mesh faces that are selected. Only the outline of the selected faces will be drawn. This will not apply for any view that
has its <g>Fill in Mesh</g> function active (checked) in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#viewoptions">Views Options</a> dialog.

<i>Front faces only </i>&nbsp;: This will only allow the solid color filling of the front faces to be drawn for any of the
models mesh faces that are selected. The back faces will be outlined allowing the models texture to be displayed if the
view is in <g>Textured</g> mode. This will not apply for any view that has its <g>Fill in Mesh</g> function active
(checked) in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#viewoptions">Views Options</a> dialog.

<i>Back faces only </i>&nbsp;: This will only allow the drawing of the backface pattern to be drawn for any of the models
mesh faces that are selected. The front faces will be outlined allowing the models texture to be displayed if the view is
in 'Textured' mode. This will not apply for any view that has its <g>Fill in Mesh</g> function active (checked) in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#viewoptions">Views Options</a> dialog.

<i>Sync Skin-view with Editor views </i>&nbsp;: This function will turn off other related options and synchronize selected
Editor views mesh vertexes, passing and selecting the coordinated <g>Skin mesh vertexes</g> in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>,
where they can be used for editing purposes. Any selection changes in the Editor views will be updated to the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a> as well. Once the selection has been passed, if this function is
