<i><b>Grid scale in 2D views</b></i>: See detailed <a href="#gridscale">sub-menu</a> and description below.

<i><b>Ruler guide in 2D views</b></i>: See detailed <a href="#rulerguide">sub-menu</a> and description below.

<i><b>3D Rotation Options</b></i>: See detailed <a href="#rotation">sub-menu</a> and description below.

<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Draw handles while rotating</a></b></i>: This allows the models vertex handles (if active) to be drawn during
rotation, but this will slow down the redrawing process and can make rotation seem jerky.

<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Editor True 3D mode</a></b></i>: This causes the Model Editor's 3D view to operate the same as
the Map Editor when maneuvering and also allows passing through a component. This is very useful when working on scenes
to see ' into ' the model and work on other components within it.

<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Full3D True 3D mode</a></b></i>: This causes the FIRST Full 3D view opened only, to operate the same as
the Map Editor when maneuvering and also allows passing through a component. This is very useful when working on scenes
to see ' into ' the model and work on other components within it. All other floating Full 3D views will operate as usual.
If the first is closed and the next uses this option the last camera position of the first one will still be in effect.

<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Model Axis in views</a></b></i>: This displays the models axis on which it was built in all views,
showing its X, Y and Z direction. The size of its letter indicators and line thickness can be increased or
decreased by using the '<g>Set Line Thickness</g>' function, a little further down. Their individual colors can
be changedin the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#coloroptions">Colors Options</a> settings.

<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Draw back faces</a></b></i>: This allows the back face checkerboard pattern to be drawn in all view modes when the
<g>'Views Options', 'Mesh in Frames'</g> of the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.viewselection.html#viewoptions">Views Options</a>
is checked for that view. Using the option in this manner will help to distinguish which direction the faces are facing for proper construction.

<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Set Line Thickness</a></b></i>: This lets you set the thickness of certain lines that are drawn on the Editor's views,
such as the outlining of selected model mesh faces and the models axis lines.

<i><b>Bone Options</b></i>: See detailed <a href="#boneoptions">sub-menu</a> and description below.

<i><b>Editor Face Selection Options</b></i>: See detailed <a href="#editorfaceselectionoptions">sub-menu</a> and description below.

<i><b>Editor Vertex Selection Options</b></i>: See detailed <a href="#editorvertexselectionoptions">sub-menu</a> and description below.

<i><b>Skin-view Options</b></i>: See detailed <a href="#skinviewoptions">sub-menu</a> and description below.

<a name="autoframerenaming"></a>
<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Auto Frame Renaming</a></b></i>: Some models consist of more then one component.
If so, their frame names should always match. When checked, if a frame of one component is renamed,
this will cause the same frame of all the other related components to be renamed also automatically.

<a name="pasteobjectsatscreencenter"></a>
<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Paste objects at screen center</a></b></i>: Check this if you
want objects that you paste into the editor's views to appear in the center of the current editor's view.
Uncheck it, and it will paste it at the exact position as the original.

<a name="enlargeverticesticks"></a>
<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Enlarge Vertices Ticks</a></b></i>: This makes the model's ticks 1 size larger for easer viewing.

<a name="rebuild3dviews"></a>
<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Rebuild 3D views</a></b></i>: This rebuilds the 3D views (actually all views) in the Model Editor
in case of a lockup. You may have to do this a few times to clear the views up. The easiest way is to just push the HotKey until the views unlock and clear up.

<a name="axisxyzletters"></a>
<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Axis XYZ letter indicator in view windows</a></b></i>: This display s the X Y or Z indicator letter
per view to associate the rotation menu buttons. These are for reference only and are not selectable
with the mouse.

<a name="listofplugins"></a>
<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">List of Plug-ins</a></b></i>&: Opens a window which shows what plug-ins QuArK has loaded.

<a name="configuration"></a>
<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Configuration</a></b></i>: Takes you to the <ref> intro/configuration </ref>.

<a name="logconsole"></a>
<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Log Console</a></b></i>: When active this will write everything that is printed
to the console to a text file called 'Console.txt' which is located in QuArK's main folder.

<a name="clearconsolelog"></a>
<i><b><a href="#optionsmenu">Clear Console Log</a></b></i>: When clicked this will clear everything that is
printed to the text file called 'Console.txt' which is located in QuArK's main folder.

<a name="gridscale"></a>
<b><u><a href="#optionsmenu">Grid scale in 2D views</a></u></b> - sub-menu :

<img border=0 align=right>gridscale.png</img>
These functions allow you to display a scale and tick mark guides
of the current grid setting in any one, combination, or all of the 2D views of the Editor, as
shown in the top sub-menu. You can also center any one or combination of the scales for
each view. If ' All 2D views '  or ' all scales centered '  is checked, it will deactivate this
menu's individual items.

<tr><td valign=top>
<a name="rulerguide"></a>
<b><u><a href="#optionsmenu">Ruler guide in 2D views</a></u></b> - sub-menu :

<img border=0 align=right>rulerguide.png</img>
 These functions allow you to display a line with the unit distance
of total selected items in any one, combination, or all of the 2D views of the Editor. Much like
the&nbsp;'Grid scale in 2D views'&nbsp; function above, this feature also has its own list of selections,
as shown in the far right sub-menu. If one of these sub-menu items is active, checked, then when ever a single
<g>face</g>, <g>object</g> or <g>component</g> is selected a&nbsp;'Ruler'&nbsp; will be displayed above and/or
beside them from the starting point to the end point of the selected items along with&nbsp;'0'&nbsp; at the
starting point and the total amount of their distance at the end point.

<tr><td valign=top>
<a name="rotation"></a>
<b><u><a href="#optionsmenu">3D Rotation Options</a></u></b> - sub-menu :

<img border=0 align=right>rotation.png</img>
<u><i>Original 3Dview rotation</i></u>: This is the way QuArK's model rotation has worked in the past.
As long as the model drag is started flat (z at 0) it rotates and tilts during rotation fine.
But if it does a hiccup during the drag with the model tilted that is when it starts to drift
off center and possibly out of the view eventually. The model can be placed anywhere in the view and
rotated from that location.

<u><i>Lock to center of 3Dview</i></u>: This method 'locks' the center of the grid to the center of the 3D view
and rotates from the 0,0,0, point of the grid, its center. If the grid is off to another location of
the view it will 'snap' back to the views center. The cursor location does not matter for dragging,
the grid will remain in the views center. This makes the rotation very consistent.
You can rotate and zoom in for close detail work on the model. But if you start another rotation
it will jump back to the grids center and probably throw your up close position off.

<u><i>Lock to center of model</i></u>: This function 'locks' the center of the model to the center of the view.
It functions just like the 'Lock to center of 3Dview' method above
based on the center of the model. However, because not all models are created at the center of their grid
the method above could cause it to be near the edge of the view or completely out of view.
This option compensates for that and will put the model in the proper center location of the view.
The same situation will exist for up close detail work if a new rotation is started.

<u><i>Rotate at start position</i></u>: This function is designed to give far more rotation consistency based on
where the cursor is at the time it is clicked to start a rotation at some place on the model.
It will then re-center that position to the center of the view to start rotating from.
Unlike the 'Original 3Dview rotation' method, this would allow close up detail rotation without
the model jumping back to some other location as in all of the above cases.
