title: The Skin-view Mesh(s)
author: cdunde

A model is constructed from a mesh, which is a list of triangles grouped together to create its shape.
The model can be a single mesh or it can consist of a number of meshes. In QuArK we call these meshes <g>components</g>.
And therefore, each <g>component</g> of a model has its own group of triangles which are known as a components
<a href="src.quarkx.html#objectsmodeleditor">Tris Specific</a> as stated in the
<a href="src.quarkx.html#objectsmodeleditor">Quarkx Model Editor section</a> of these Infobase docs.
<g>Tris</g> is an abbreviation for triangles.

The <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a> will display an <g>unwrapped</g>, or flat
version, of each of the model's components when it or any of its sub-items have been selected in the tree-view.

The <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a> works a bit defiantly then the editor's views do,
based on the fact that it has no actual triangles. Only what is known as <g>view.handles</g>, view being the view
displayed on the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a> itself. Another big difference,
at this time, is that unlike all of the other <g>views</g> of the editor which are in a <g>list</g> of its 
<g>editor.layout.view</g>, the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a> view is never actually added
(appended) to that list, on a permanent bases, making it pretty much isolated from the rest of the views of the editor.
Because of this I needed to create a <g>global</g> in the <g>quarkpy\mdlhandles.py</g> file called <g>SkinView1</g>
that can be used, when needed, to call that view when the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a> is open.
It does seem to be added periodically when the mouse cursor is actually somewhere within the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a> view.

As briefly described in the <a href="src.quarkx.html#objectsmodeleditorl">Internal objects related to the Model Editor</a>
of the <ref>src/quarkx</ref> section of these Infobase docs, the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a>
view uses a model's <g>Component, Frame object's vertices</g>, also known as its views <b>view.handles</b>. There is a lot
being said in that last part, so let me break it down for you in more layman's terms as to what it all means exactly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><g>Component</g> :</g></i> Each model can be made up of one or more <g>Components</g>, or parts,
each containing sub-items, as described in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.model.html#components">Components of a Model</a>
section above, one of which is the <b>frame group</b> that contains that particular components <g>animation frames</g>
that gives that component its movement sequences.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><g>Frame object's vertices</g> :</g></i> Each <b>frame</b> has attached to it a list of vertexes or points in
3D space that make up that components <g>Frame</g>, or mesh of triangles for its shape. These vertexes are the
<g>Frame object's vertices</g> which are also the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a> <b>view.handles</b>.
Below is a very small sample of a Skin-view <b>view.handles</b> list.<br>

<code>
[&lt;quarkpy.mdlhandles.SkinHandle instance at 0x0101AA08>,&lt;quarkpy.mdlhandles.SkinHandle instance at 0x0101AA58>]
</code>

Each item in this list, as you can see, is an <g>instance</g> of a <g>quarkpy.mdlhandles.SkinHandle</g> and if you look
at that <g>Class SkinHandle</g> in the quarkpy\mdlhandles.py folder\file you will see that each <g>instance</g> has these
items, or <g>Specifics</g> that make up that <g>SkinHandle</g>, or <g>Frame object's vertices</g> point.

<code>
def __init__(self, pos, tri_index, ver_index, comp, texWidth, texHeight, triangle):
</code>


<g>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self</g> &nbsp;-----------&nbsp;being the handle or <g>quarkpy.mdlhandles.SkinHandle instance</g> itself.<br>
<g>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pos</g> &nbsp;-----------&nbsp;that handle's 3D position in space when it was created or changed.<br>
<g>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tri_index</g> &nbsp;----&nbsp;the triangle number of the component that view.handle belongs to.<br>
<g>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ver_index</g> &nbsp;--&nbsp;the vertex position of that triangle in sequential order, 0, 1 or 2.<br>
<g>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comp</g> &nbsp;--------&nbsp;the model component that triangle and view.handle is a part of.<br>
<g>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;texWidth</g> &nbsp;----&nbsp;the computed width of the texture <g>skin</g> image that component uses.<br>
<g>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;texHeight</g> &nbsp;---&nbsp;the computed height of the texture <g>skin</g> image that component uses.<br>
<g>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;triangle</g> &nbsp;------&nbsp;the triangle itself that view.handle is a part of.<br>

The data any one of these items contain can be used by simply adding its <g>Specific</g> name to the view.handle like this:
<code>vtxpoint = view.handle.pos</code>
These view.handle positions are then used to draw the handles onto the Skin-view's view and the lines that make up that
components <g>Skin mesh</g>, but there are still no triangles per-say. These <g>Specifics</g> data can also be used to pass
the needed items data from the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a> to the editor's views and visa-versa
as seen in the <g>quarkpy\mdlutils.py</g> file for the <g>PassSkinSel2Editor</g> and <g>PassEditorSel2Skin</g> functions which
are located there, you might want to review those as additional detailed information for those functions use, explanation and data format
are also located there for each function along with a simpler <g>formula</g> for the <g>PassEditorSel2Skin</g> function that can
expedite its application time for obtaining data that it needs.

There are two other functions, as well as several more useful ones, in the <g>quarkpy\mdlutils.py</g> file that you should also be aware of called:

<g>Update_Editor_Views</g>:&nbsp; Updates the Editors views once something has changed in the Skin-view, such as 
synchronized or added 'skin mesh' vertex selections. It can also be used to just update all of the Editor's views only.

<g>MakeEditorFaceObject</g>:&nbsp; Creates a QuArK Internal Face Object from 3 selected vertexes in the ModelVertexSelList.
This one is unique to the <b>Model Editor</b> in that it uses the same structure as a <b>Map Editor</b> QuArK Internal Face Object,
Which should allow the calling of various Map Editor files and functions in the Python code files to use in the Model Editor once
the returned items from those functions are converted back into usable data in the Model Editor required format.

Both of the above functions have various <g>option</g> settings that can be applied for more specific uses and those option
settings and descriptions are in each of their related function description section.

One last item to cover are the various <g>selection lists</g> that I have setup for the Model Editor. Each one being specific for their needs and uses.

<g>ModelVertexSelList</g>:&nbsp; Used for individual and multi selected Model Editor component mesh vertexes.

<g>SkinVertexSelList</g>:&nbsp; Used for individual and multi selected Skin-view skin mesh vertexes.

<g>ModelFaceSelList</g>:&nbsp; Used for individual and multi selected Model Editor component mesh triangles (faces).

<g>SkinFaceSelList</g>:&nbsp; Used for <g>passing and retaining</g> individual and multi selected Model Editor component mesh triangles (faces) to the Skin-view page at this time.

Complete detailed descriptions of each one of these <g>selection lists</g> are given near the top of the <g>quarkpy\mdleditor.py</g> file along with their related list item formats
as to what data they require and carry as well as to what their purpose are. It would be a good idea to review that information as more will be added during future development of this editor.

<b>One vital point about the <g>SkinVertexSelList</g> list is that it <g>must</g> be <g>changeable</g>, or <g>mutable</g> in Python terms,
and the added data within it, or the list will become ineffective and objects will not be able to be updated when moved to work with QuArK.
They will simply <g>DISAPEAR</g> !</b>

To make this list <g>mutable</g> it must use <g>square brackets</g> to define it and any items that are added to that list as well, like this:

<code>
SkinVertexSelList = []
SkinVertexSelList = SkinVertexSelList + [pos, self, tri_index, ver_index]
</code>

In addition to the above <g>selection lists</g> there are other lists used by the Model Editor, two of which are:

<g>view.handles</g>:&nbsp; Covered in detail above earlier.

<g>comp.filltris</g>:&nbsp; <g>comp</g> being the currently selected model component or <g>editor.Root.currentcomponent</g>
and the actual list <g>filltris</g> which is a list of item settings to draw a component's triangle filled with a specified
color and which is also described in the <a href="src.quarkx.html#objectsmodeleditorl">Internal objects related to the Model Editor</a>
of the <ref>src/quarkx</ref> section of these Infobase docs. Also doing a word search using <g>comp.filltris</g> will divulge
its usage in the Python <g>quarkpy\mdleditor.py</g> file.

I realize there is a lot more relating to the editor but this very vital basic works information should help to get acquainted
with the <b>QuArK Model Editor</b> inter actions much easer.
