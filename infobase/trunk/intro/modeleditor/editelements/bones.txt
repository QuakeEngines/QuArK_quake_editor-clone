title: Bones System
author: cdunde

<g>Bones</g> are used primarily for the animation, movement, of models in the same way that our bodies
<g>Skeleton</g> bones are. The editor has one <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Skeleton folder</a>
where these bones are kept, if there are any. They can be applied to a single model <g>Component</g>,
multipul components of a single model or components of another model that has been imported.
Even though a model may not come with its own bones, you can still create your own set of bones and store them
in a QuArK Model <g>.qkl</g> Work File.

The use of bones is activated by clicking on a single frame of any component and either the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Skeleton folder</a>
in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a>, if there are bones, or by
opening that folder and clicking on any of the bones inside it. Once activated, all of this systems
controlling functions are located on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">Editor Views RMB menu</a> for
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#bonecommands">Bone Commands</a>. Reading their brief descriptions
will give you a quick understanding of each function. For a quick reference, hold your cursor over any menu
item and press your <b>F1</b> key for its help box that will also give you its use information.
A <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Skeleton folder</a> selection causes all <g>attached</g>
bones to move together, while a single bone selection only moves that particular bone.
Moving a bone below its attached bone in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a>
will give you access to that bone's end handle for assigning vertexes if needed. However, it is advisable to
assign them to the start handles, except for the last bone of each set.

<g><i><b><u>Basic Applications</u></b></i></g>&nbsp;:<br>

The first step is to <a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#bonecommands">Add a Bone</a>.
To do this you must be in <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html">Vertex mode</a>
and not <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html#linear">Linear Drag Handles mode</a>
as the bones will not be displayed.
Then do a <g>LMB</g> click, in one of the editor's <g>2D views</g> where you want to place the bone,
to get the popup menu, go to <a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">Bone Commands</a>
then click on <a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#bonecommands">Add Bone Here</a>.

By selecting a <b>single component</b> in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a> both the start and end handles
of the new bone will be assigned to that <b>component</b>. Otherwise they will be assigned to the
first component in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a>.
This will change automatically if any vertexes of another component are assigned to a bone's handle,
which means bones can be spread across different components within the editor if needed.

Each bone has a <g>start handle</g>, where the lines are the widest, and an <g>end handle</g>, where the lines
meet in the middle. The middle of each handle is the <g>center drag</g> point, which does the lateral movements,
and the four yellow rectangles are the <g>corner drag</g> points, any one of these do the rotation and scaling (Ctrl key) movements.

The next set of bones show how you can
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#bonecommands">Continue the bones</a> by placing your cursor over the
<g>center point</g> of the previous bone's <g>end handle</g>, do a <g>LMB</g> click and select
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#bonecommands">Continue Bones</a> from the popup menu.
This can be done with any bone at any time. You will also notice how these different menu functions will
become active when they can be used properly.

The third set of bones show how to select and <a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#bonecommands">Assign</a>
a number of vertexes to a bone handle, preferably its <g>start handle</g>. First select any <b>single bone</b>
in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Skeleton folder</a>, the single frame should still
be selected, then select a number of vertexes by doing a <g>LMB drag</g> in the view over those vertexes.
Now do a <g>LMB</g> click (hold button briefly for <a href="#autoselection">auto selection</a>)
on the <b>center</b> of the bone handle
you want to assign those vertexes too, do a <g>RMB</g> click on its center and select
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#bonecommands">Assign to Start</a> or
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#bonecommands">Assign to End</a>, depending on which handle
you are working with, from the popup menu.
The handle will automatically center itself on those vertexes.
You can <a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#bonecommands">Set the Handle Position</a> a couple of ways
which is covered below, along with more about the built in
<a href="#autoselection">auto selection capabilities</a>.

The last set of bones demonstrate a variety of features, capabilities and <g>Specific Settings</g>
of the bone system, see below.


<img border=1 align=right>bones2.png</img>
<a name="specificsettings"></a>
<g><i><b><u>Specific Settings</u></b></i></g>&nbsp;:<br>
When a single bone, or a single bone and other component items are selected, a number of settings can
be made for that bone on its <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">Specifics/Args</a>
page shown to the right.

<u><i>classname </i></u>&nbsp;: Here the name of the bone can be changed to any name you choose.
This can also be done in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a>
by pressing your <b>F2</b> key.
One will update the other.

<u><i>Bone Length </i></u>&nbsp;: A bone can be any length you desire by either dragging one
of its handles in any of the editor's views or by giving it an exact length here.

<u><i>Length Locked </i></u>&nbsp;: When this box is checked, by clicking on it, the length will not
change when that bone is dragged or rotated when that bone itself is selected. However, its length can still be
changed when the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Skeleton Group folder</a> is selected.

<u><i>component </i></u>&nbsp;: This will show the name of the component currently assigned to a bones handle.
This is a read only value and can not be change by hand, only by component assignment.

<u><i>vertexes </i></u>&nbsp;: This will show how many vertexes are currently assigned to a bones handle.
This is a read only value and can not be change by hand, only by vertex assignment.

<u><i>color </i></u>&nbsp;: The color bar, when clicked on, will bring up a color selection window where
you can choose any color you like for that bone handle. There is also an option on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">Bone Options</a> sub-menu called
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#editorboneoptions">Match Bone Lines Color</a>
that, when checked, the <a href="#bonelinescolor">bone lines color</a> displayed during a drag will match the handle color being dragged.
Any vertexes assigned to that handle will be displayed in that same color.

<u><i>position </i></u>&nbsp;: This is the exact 3D position of a bones handle that gets updated at the end
of each drag, or and exact position can be set here.

<u><i>offset </i></u>&nbsp;: Sometimes a bone's handle can be in the way of other things. Here an offset
3D value can be entered, for x, y and z, to reposition that handle in relation to any vertexes assigned to it.
Be advised that any rotation will be based on its offset position, which is the center point of that handle.

<u><i>scale </i></u>&nbsp;: Here the size of a bone's handle can be set to make it bigger, to see other
bone's handles attached to it, or smaller, as detail work so requires. These settings have no effect on
rotation, since that is based on the center point of a handle.

<g><i><b><u>Special Features</u></b></i></g>&nbsp;:<br>

<a name="autoselection"><g>Auto Selection Capabilities :</g></a><br>
There are a few criteria’s that need to be followed in order for bones to work properly, or at all,
for a drag to take place. These are:
<ul>
<li> Only a singe frame and the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Skeleton Group folder</a>
can be selected, or
<li> Only a single frame and a single bone can be selected.
<li> If a bone's handle has vertexes assigned to it, or an attached bone's handle does, a single frame must also be selected.
<li> If no vertexes have been assigned then a single frame selection is not required.
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the above criteria it can be cumbersome if you constantly
need to use your <g>Ctrl</g> key to maneuver in the selection of these items, therefore:
<ul>
<li> Select any single frame, you can then select the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Skeleton Group folder</a>
or any single bone without having to use your <g>Ctrl</g> key, that frame will remain selected.
<li> You can select another single frame and the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Skeleton Group folder</a>
or single bone will remain selected. (deactivated at this time)
<li> With a single frame selected, you can bounch from the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Skeleton Group folder</a>
to any single bone, or from one bone to another without having to use your <g>Ctrl</g> key
<li> or you can bounch from frame to frame without having to use your <g>Ctrl</g> key. (deactivated at this time)

<li> To cancel this action, click on the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Frames Group folder</a>
<li> or any blank unused area in one of the editor's views or the model itself
<li> or select some other folder besides the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Skeleton Group folder</a>.
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the bone handles will appear to be active but no drag
can take place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is because your selection in the tree-view does not meet
the above criteria and you simply need to make the correct selection.

<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#bonecommands">Key frames Movement :</a> (not dependable at this time)<br>
To activate this menu item you <b>must</b> have <b>two single frames</b> and the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Skeleton Group folder</a>
selected. This is because those two frames will be used to <g>spread</g> the movement from the first frame to the second
evenly over the frames that are between them. For example, you want to do a walking motion, the first frame has the arms and legs
swung in one direction and the last, second, frame has them in the opposite positions. With a spread of about 10 frames you will
create an animation of a fast walk, with a spread of 20 frames the motion would seem a bit slower. <b>Be advised</b>, the
outcome may not always be what you expect and even though they can be reversed by using the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#editmenu">Undo system</a> that could still cause a crash of the program.
So it is highly recommended that you always save your work before using this function.

<a name="bonelinescolor"><g>Bone Lines & Vertex Colors :</g></a><br>
When a bone's handles colors are set on its
<a href="#specificsettings">Specific Settings</a> page and the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">Bone Options</a> sub-menu
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#editorboneoptions">Match Bone Lines Color</a> is check these line colors
act as a guide to help distinguish which bone's handle is being dragged. They also work differently when the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Skeleton Group folder</a> is selected as opposed to a single bone.

when the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">Skeleton Group folder</a> is selected all of the lines
share the same color as the drag handle, all the way <g>down line</g> for any connected bones that are also being moved
or rotated. Where as for a single bone, only its lines, matching the drag handle, and any connecting bone handles will display
their respective handle's color.

For any bone's that are using the default colors, those colors will be reverse when a drag is being made, also when a single
bone or bones are selected those lines will become the default blue color, as long as there are no frames or other folders
selected as well.

Any vertexes assigned to a bone handle will be displayed using that same handle's color. Releasing or re-assigning vertexes
to another handle will change their display color respectively.
