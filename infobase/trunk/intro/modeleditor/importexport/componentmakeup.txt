title: What Makes Up a Model Component
author: cdunde

A model is a single <b>QuArK Internal Object</b> that can consist of a single or multiple <g>components</g>.
The elements that make up a model are stored as "<g>key</g> <b>:</b> <g>value</g>" pairs of the QuArK Internal Object,
where there is a <g>key</g> name and a <g>value</g> that goes along with that <g>key</g> name.

Also, each of the "key names" CAN BE given a specific <g>type</g> to distinguish what kind of element it is.<br>
So an example of a <g>key</g>, its <g>type</g> and its related <g>value</g> would look like this:
<code>{'teeth:mc': &lt;QuArK Internal object at 0x00CC1E4C>}</code>

The <g>key</g> name is teeth, its <g>type</g> mc (model component) and its <g>value</g> is another QuArK Internal Object
containing its <g>subitems</g>, <g>dictspec</g> items and <g>dictitems</g>.<br>
This method of using "<g>key</g><b>:</b><g>value</g>" pairs runs all the way through as a model's <g>component(s)</g>
elements are broken down.

<b><g>subitems</g> :</b> This is a list of <b>QuArK Internal Objects</b> that make up a component and controls the order
that they are displayed in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.overview.html#overview">editor's tree-view</a>.<br>
They consist of the <g>Skins</g> group (its texture images), <g>Frames</g> group (its animation\<g>vertexes</g> frames)
and, <g>SDO</g> group (SkinDrawObject) which is not really used at this time but still needs to be created.

A <a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#bones">Skeleton</a> group (its bones if any) is created outside of,and shaired by,
the components. This group is covered in detail <a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#bones">further below</a>.

The creation of the <g>subitems</g> list is not something you need to be concerned about when writing an
<g>importer or exporter file</g>.<br>
QuArK takes care of that internally using the component's <g>dictitems</g> below.

<a name="dictitems1"></a>
<b><g>dictitems</g> :</b> These are other <g>dictionary</g> items within the component that make it up, they are the
same items as its <g>subitems</g> and each one is a <g>key</g> <b>:</b> <g>value</g> pair that an <g>importer</g> file
will use to create a <g>QuArK editor component</g>, for example:
<code>
{
 'SDO:sdo': <QuArK Internal object at 0x0165FE7C>, # stands for SkinDrawObject
 'Skins:sg': <QuArK Internal object at 0x0166D48C>,
 'Frames:fg': <QuArK Internal object at 0x0166D864>
}
</code>
Notice how these items are not in any particular order. Because they are <g>dictionary list</g> they do not need to be.
We use their <g>key</g> name to get what goes along with them, not the order that they are in the <g>dictitems list</g>.
Each of these <g>dictitems</g> brake down into their own <g>dictspecs</g> items, but <a href="#dictitems2">more on that later<a>.

<a name="dictspec1"></a>
<b><g>dictspec items</g> :</b> These are <g>key</g> <b>:</b> <g>value</g> item pairs that pertain to the component and
its <g>subitems</g> as a whole and are only QuArK editor related.<br>
They are individual dictionary items that contain settings for that component. Some of these settings are used and reset
by simply moving things around in the editor, such as <g>vertexes</g>, while others are used to fill in the values
on the <g>editor's Specifics/Args</g> page where they can be viewed and\or reset there. The <g>importer</g> file will
create these items (<a href="#dictspec2">covered in detail later<a>), for example:<br>
<u>dictspec items of a model component</u> :
<code>{'skinsize': (128.0, 64.0), 'Tris': '\x00\x00\x7f\...(a bunch more), 'show': '\x01'}</code>
<g>'skinsize'</g> is the size of a component's first skin image or a default size of <g>(256, 256)</g> can be used if
there are no skins.<br>
<g>'show'</g> Components can be <g>Hidden</g> in the editor (not seen) when this is set to <g>'\x00'</g> and visible
when set to <g>'\x01'</g>, so it should always be set to the latter.<br>
<g>'Tris'</g> This is the primary one we will be concerned with when writing a <g>model importer</g> or <g>exporter</g> file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its <g>value</g> is in <g>binary</g> code
and needs to remain so to work in QuArK.
Think of this code as one big list of smaller, individual list.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of which contain three items,
a <g>vert_index</g> (vertex index number), a <g>U</g> texture position value and a <g>V</g> texture position value.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <g>U, V</g> values give the flat
<g>2D</g> x , y position of that vertex on the model's skin (in <g>pixels</g>) and the <g>vert_index</g> points to that vertex.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each vertex can have more then one
<g>U, V</g> value and this is a key point to remember. But more will be covered on that later.

<u>dictspec items of a frame</u> :
<code>{'index': (17.0,), 'Vertices': (-1.859375, 31.234375, ...(a bunch more), 54.078125)}</code>
<g>'index'</g> It is <b><g>critical</g></b>, for the QuArK Model Editor to work efficiently,
that each frame has its own index number starting with the count of <g>(1.0,)</g> and continue in numerical order.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note the comma after the number. It must be written this way to make it a <g>tuple</g> in the <g>Python</g> code.<br>
<g>'Vertices'</g> This is a continuous list of float values that give the <g>x,y,z position</g> for each vertex of a model's
component mesh. QuArK's internal code breaks these into groups of three to accomplish this, and of course it takes three
vertexes, most of which are shared, to make a single triangle of a models mesh.

So there you have it, the breakdown of a component...which can be a bit bewildering at first, but just remember,<br>
you have a <g>dictionary</g> inside a <g>dictionary</g> inside a <g>dictionary</g>.... 
and just about every <g>dictionary</g> has <g>dictspec</g> items that pertain directly to it.

Now for their relationship between one another in making up a QuArK model component in a <g>model importer</g> file
and used for the <g>exporter</g> file as well.<br>
By the way...don't make an importer without an exporter to go along with it...that can be extremely frustrating to others.

All of these files are in the <g>QuArK\plugins</g> folder and are
written in <g>Python</g>, look at <g>ie_md2_import.py</g> as a guide. Also, all of them <b>MUST</b> start with <g>ie_</g> for their name.<br>
That is used to identify them for file loading purposes when QuArK's Model Editor is started up.
Otherwise they will not show up on the <g>Importer \ Exporter</g> menu.

As we go through each item of a component, its title is shown the same way it would be written in <g>Python</g>
code to gain access to it in an <g>importer</g> or <g>exporter</g> file.

<a name="dictitems2"></a>
<b><u><a href="#dictitems1">Component.dictitems :</a></u></b>

<img border=0 align=right>componentmakeup1.png</img>
<g>Component.dictitems['Frames:fg'].dictspec :</g><br>
The only item here is <g>{'type': '\x01'}</g> which must be written to the frames group as shown.<br>
<g><SMALL>Component.dictitems['Frames:fg'].dictspec['type'] = '\x01'</SMALL></g><br>
This is its group type which is used by QuArK's internal source code to identify and handle it.

<g>Component.dictitems['Frames:fg'].dictitems :</g>
These are individual dictionary items, one for each frame in the frame group, for example:<br>
<g><SMALL>'Frame 1:mf': &lt;QuArK Internal object at 0x016827FC></SMALL></g><br>
Each <g>frame</g> has its own <g>dictspec</g> items which are <g>'index'</g> and <g>'Vertices'</g>.<br>
<b>index</b> is its position in the frames group, ex:<br>
<g><b>(0.0,)</b></g> the comma behind it means it is a <g>tuple</g>.<br>
<b>Vertices</b> is a list of all its <g>3D</g> vertex positions.<br>
Each vertex position has an <b>x, y and z</b> float value, ex: <g>-1.859375</g> (positive or negative)<br>
and since it is the first item in this list its <g>vert_index</g> would be <b><g>0</b></g> shown as <b>Vertex 0</b>.<br>
These items are indicated in <font color="RED">red</font> to the right.

Even though this is a <g>continuous list</g>, QuArK knows to brake them up into groups of three (x,y,z) for each vertex.

So all of a frames vertexes make up the <g>points</g> in 3D space that give the model <g>mesh</g> its shape.
And it takes three of these vertexes to make a single <g>face</g> of the <g>mesh</g>, even though most vertexes are what
we call <g>common vertexes</g>, meaning that they are shared with other <g>faces</g> of the <g>mesh</g>.
That's what holds a <g>mesh</g> together as one complete unit. Other wise you could pull it apart into individual
<g>faces</g> or pieces...not a good thing.

<a name="footnote1a"></a>
If a model has more then one <g>frame</g>, these vertex positions change from frame to frame, thus creating its
animation movement, but that can also be handled using other files and methods from one model format to another.<br>
<a href="#footnote1b">(see added footnote 1 below for more info)</a>

<a name="tris1"></a>
Even though the frame <g>vertexes</g> provide the mesh's <g>3D points in space</g>, the lines between those points
(or <g>vertexes</g>) still need to be drawn and a working relationship between them still needs to be connected
from one to the other and the other... to create a completed and joined mesh.
That is done by the <g>Component.dictspec{'Tris']</g> item.

<a name="dictspec2"></a>
<b><u><a href="#dictspec1">Component.dictspec :</a></u></b>

<g>Component.dictspec{'Tris']</g><br>
As indicated by the <font color="BLUE">blue line</font> to the right,<br>
(put your mouse over these for their results)<br>
the <a href="" title="The entire list of triangle faces shown to the right __/ ">'Tris'</a> is one big list of individual sub-list and each sub-list consist of three items,
one for each vertex of a face (or triangle), and each vertex consist of three items
also. 1) vert_index, 2) U texture position and 3) V texture position. Follow the <font color="BLUE">blue line</font>
to see how each vert_index links to its actual <b>x,y,z</b> 3D point position in a <a href="" title=" \__ The entire Models's 'frame vertices'&#10;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;list shown further above">frame['Vertices']</a> list (covered above)<br>
This is how the two lists link to one another. When refering to the <a href="" title=" \__ The entire list of triangle faces shown above">'Tris'</a> a <a href="" title="a triangle index number">tri_index</a>
(triangle index) number is used that relates to its <a href="" title="where it's located in the list,&#10;starting from position 0 (zero)">group's poistion</a> in the <a href="" title=" \__ The entire list of triangle faces shown above">'Tris'</a> list.

So the first triangle (<a href="" title=" tri_index 0 ">tri_index</a>) in the list would be:
<a href="" title=" tri_index 0 = ((2, 83, 105), (1, 216, 78), (0, 216 303)) "><SMALL>Component.dictspec['Tris'][0]</SMALL></a>
its first vertex: <a href="" title=" vert_index 0 = (2, 83, 105) "><SMALL>Component.dictspec['Tris'][0][0]</SMALL></a><br>
and that vertex's vert_index: <a href="" title="vert_index 0 = 2 &#10;frame vertices 2 = -1.5, 31.65625, 53.265625"><SMALL>Component.dictspec['Tris'][0][0][0]</SMALL></a>
its <b><a href="" title=" U = 83 ">U</a></b> value: <a href="" title=" U = 83 "><SMALL>Component.dictspec['Tris'][0][0][1]</SMALL></a> and
its <b><a href="" title=" V = 105 ">V</a></b> value:
<a href="" title=" V = 105 "><SMALL>Component.dictspec['Tris'][0][0][2]</SMALL></a> that's it.<br>
The second vert_index would be: <a href="" title="vert_index 1 = (1, 216, 78) &#10;frame vertices 1 = -1.171875, 29.25, 52.75"><SMALL>Component.dictspec['Tris'][0][1]</SMALL></a> and
the third vert_index would be: <a href="" title="vert_index 2 = (0, 216 303) &#10;frame vertices 0 = -1.859375, 31.234375, 52.65625"><SMALL>Component.dictspec['Tris'][0][2]</SMALL></a>.

Also notice how each vert_index (vertex) can have more then one U,V texture position
(indicated by the <font color="GREEN">green</font> and <font color="FUSHA">fusha</font> lines).<br>
It is this vertex multiple uv capability system that allows the skinning of model sections
on different <g>tiles</g> (repeated) images of a components skin texture. So even though
a model's component mesh is one combined object, its texturing can be made up of many sections,
either stacked on top of one another or spread out over many copies of its texture making it much
easer to get to and work with those areas.

================================================ Footnotes ==================================================

<a name="footnote1b"><u>footnote 1</u>: Model Animation Methods</a><br>
As <a href="#footnote1a">mentioned above</a>, model formats can use different methods of animating a model.
For example, <b>Quake 2</b> <g>.md2</g> models use <g>frames</g>, like we have been covering, for their movement,
animation, while <b>Quake 4</b> models use <g>Lightwave model formats</g> which are <g>.lwo, .md5mesh</g> and
<g>.md5anim</g> files. The <g>.lwo</g> is a <g>static</g> model, meaning it only has one <g>frame</g> and it does
not have any animation movement to it. While the <g>.md5mesh</g> and <g>.md5anim</g> files (which are text files)
are used together to create a moving model. The <g>.md5mesh</g> is a <g>static</g> model that gives
the model its base shape and the <g>.md5anim</g> file gives the vertex movement for its animation.
It gets a bit more complicated then that as to how they work exactly, but that is the basic method used for that format.
