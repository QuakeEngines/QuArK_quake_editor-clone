<i><u><b>Using existing icons</b></u></i> :<br>
Button icons are .bmp files in the QuArK images folder which are loaded into QuArK when it starts up
using a Python all in the <g>quarkpy\qeditor.py</g> file such as this one for example:
<code>
    ico_dict['ico_maped'] = LoadIconSet1("maped", 1.0)
</code>
The <g>1.0</g> tells it to use the file with the <g>-1</g> in its name when a button is clicked.

This puts those images, which are maped-0.bmp and maped-1.bmp,
into a dictionary list <g>ico_dict</g> so that entire list of objects will be removed from memory when QuArK is closed,<br>
avoiding a memory leak. Do a word search using the above example line of code to see all of the image dictionary
list that are available to use and trace those back to the actual<br>
images in the <g>images</g> folder.

Each .bmp file is like a <g>bar</g> of icon images. The -0.bmp is used when a button is not active
and the -1.bmp is used when a button is active.<br>
Each icon image is counted from left to right starting with the digit zero to identify it.<br>
An example on how to call one would be like this:(shortened)

    from quarkpy.qeditor import ico_dict # Get the dictionary list of all icon image files available.
    import quarkpy.qtoolbar              # Get the toolbar functions to make the button with.
    ico_maped=ico_dict['ico_maped']      # Just to shorten our call later.
    icon_btns = {}                       # Setup our button list, as a dictionary list, to return at the end.
                                         # Make our first button, below, to go into the above list.
    vtxcolorbtn = quarkpy.qtoolbar.button(colorclick, "Color UV Vertex mode||When active, puts the editor\nvertex selection into this mode.|intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html", ico_maped, 10)
    icon_btns['color'] = vtxcolorbtn     # Put our button in the above list to return.

You can see at the very end of the next to the last line of code above that we are using icon 10, the 11th one,
from the maped-0.bmp and maped-1.bmp image files.

The first argument of the quarkpy.qtoolbar.button call is <g>colorclick</g>. This is the name of the function to call
when the button is activated (or clicked) that you write, define, in your import file.<br>
This name can be anything you wish and the actual function can do just about anything you want it to do in the editor,<br>
such as storing vertex and\or triangle indexes and other needed data within the component that will be needed for exporting later.

The second argument does a couple of things:
<ul>
<li> 1) Gives a brief hint, of what the button does, followed by two bars || then
<li> 2) a brief description of how to use the function and\or what it does in more detail.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows up when someone presses their <g>F1</g> key to get a help box window.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice the \n in <g>editor\nvertex</g> which causes a new line. \n\n can be use for a space between lines and so on.
<li> 3) Next we have a single bar | that allows us to provide a link to the InfoBase docs, with a button, to give more help.
<li> 4) It gives our icon list item to use and which icon from that list.
</ul>

For each button you want to add simply do it like above, with its own name like icon_btn2, and add it to the list as well.

<i><u><b>Making your own icon</b></u></i> :<br>
If you can not find an icon that gives a distinct appearance of what a button is for, then you can make your own.<br>
To keep things simple and consistent, that new icon should be added at the <b>end</b> of the mdlskv-0.bmp, mdlskv-1.bmp and
mdlskv-2.bmp files and submitted,<br>
along with your import and export files, for others to draw from.
The first five spaces, including blanks, are reserved for the editor's <g>Skin-view</g> and for future use.<br>
Notice also that the image in mdled-1.bmp and mdlskv-2.bmp are slightly brighter or even a different set of colors.
That is so when the button is active it will be more noticeable then the others.<br>
Not all buttons will need to remain active but all three files still need to have the new icon to keep things straight.

The reason there are three related image files in this set is because the mdlskv-1.bmp is used as a pass over highlighted look
when used with the proper button function type.

There are also other kinds of buttons that you can use. See the <g>quarkpy\qtoolbar</g> file or other <g>mdl</g> files for those.
