Settings in this folder are only usable if you have a Glide 2.4
or compatible graphics-card.

3D-accelerators like 3dfx, Voodoo, Voodoo-II and other low-price cards, are
<u>not</u> true OpenGL compatible, they only emulates it through a
Glide-driver.

<i>Second monitor on Glide</i>.

<i>Full-screen gamma correction</i>.

<i>Full-screen size</i>.

<i>Isometric transparent fraction</i>.

<i>Fade</i>. With this you can enable and disable the fading fog.


<u>Additional options</u>

<i>Resolution</i>. This is the resolution Glide renders at. The higher
this setting, the higher the quality, but also the slower the
rendering.

<i>Mirroring</i>. Allows you to flip the viewport around. Use this if everything renders upside-down.

<i>Color dithering</i>. Reduces color banding when downscaling colors,
at the cost of some additional noise.

<i>Face culling</i>. Speeds up rendering by making all the backsides of
faces invisible.

<i>Texture filtering</i>. This improved the texture quality, mainly under
high angles. It will make the textures appear less blocky and pixelated.
The higher the settings, the better the quality, but also the lower the
performance.

<i>Disable desktop composition</i>. On some systems, the desktop
composition feature may corrupt the rendered viewport. Enable this
option to automatically disable the desktop composition feature when a
viewport opens.

Note: Usage of emulators (such as <a target="_blank" href="http://dege.freeweb.hu/">dgVoodoo</a>)
might produce weird effects, and is generally not supported.
