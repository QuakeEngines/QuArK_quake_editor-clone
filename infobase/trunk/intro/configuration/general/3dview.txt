<i>Select 3D viewer</i>. If you have a 3Dfx-compatible 3D-acceleration
graphics card, an OpenGL-compatible 3D-acceleration graphics card, or a DirectX
3D-acceleration graphics card installed, QuArK can use it to speed up drawing
in all windows. If you don't have one or neither of those work correctly, you
can default to Software 3D rendering. Also, other renderers have more features
than the Software 3D.

<i>Position/size of window</i>. The position and size of the floating 3D-
windows. The first two numbers are the X and Y positions of the window, counted
in pixels from the upper left corner of the screen. The last two numbers are the
width and height of the window, also counted in pixels.

<i>Entities in 3D</i>. Whether or not QuArK should draw entities (3D-models) in
the 3D-windows.

<i>"Far" distance</i>. How deep QuArK should draw in the 3D-windows. Lower
values will speed up drawing.

<i>Fade density</i>. The lower the fading fog, the more you can see, but keep in
mind that the <b>"Far" distance</b> and the <b>fade density</b> are somewhat
connected.

<i>Vertical view angle</i>. The field of view of the perspective views, in
degrees. Just as with cameras expected it is not the width but the height of
the view that you enter.

<i>Fade color</i>. Want green fading fog? Change it here!

<i>Frame color</i>. The color to use on the bounding area of the 3D-windows,
where QuArK won't draw due to the choosen size of the view.

<i>Texture max-dimension</i>. The maximum width and height of a texture. Software
and 3Dfx are limited to a maximum of 256, but this is looked after automatically
by QuArK. Also, if you set it too high, QuArK will automatically scale back.


<u>Mouse sensitivity</u>

All these values controls the mouse sensitivity, when you use your mouse to
move around in the 3D-windows.
To reverse the direction of any of these settings just change the value to a negative.


<u>Keyboard settings</u>

Instead of using the mouse to move around with (which can be quite difficult at
times), you can either use these standard movement-keys when the 3D-window is
active, or redefine them to suit your needs. It is <u>highly recommended</u>
that you know how to move around in 3D-window using the keys.


<u>Keyboard movement dynamics</u>

Change these values if you feel, that moving around using the keys, isn't quite
fast or slow enough. You must experiment a bit to find a setting that you like
using.


<u>Additional settings</u>

<i>The next time...</i>. Enables or disables the warning box that shows up when you
open the 3D-windows for the first time.

<i>Close views when the game is run</i>. When enabled, QuArK will close any
3D-windows and multi-pages panels open when the game is run using the menu. This
will reduce the amount of resources QuArK uses, so the game runs more smoothly.

<i>Close views when the configurations are changed</i>. When enabled, QuArK will
close any 3D-windows and multi-pages panels open when the configurations are
changed. This will prevent any of the new settings from not correctly being
applied to views that are already open.

<i>Allow multiple 3D windows</i>. When enabled, clicking the 3D button will open new
floating 3D windows. When disabled, clicking the 3D button will just toggle one view
open/closed. Opening more than several windows will slow QuArK down, so use multiple
windows with care!

<i>Allow Escape closing</i>. When enabled, you can use the Escape key to close the
floating window that currently has focus.
