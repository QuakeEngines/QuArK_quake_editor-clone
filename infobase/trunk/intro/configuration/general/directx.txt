Settings in this folder are only usable if you have a DirectX
graphics-card.

<i>Over-the-scene lines+icons</i>. This will draw all the lines and
icons over the scene.

<i>Fade</i>. With this you can enable and disable the fading fog.

<i>Transparency</i>. With this you can enable and disable transparency.

<i>Lighting</i>. With this you can enable and disable the lighting.


<u>Additional options</u>

<i>Back buffer format</i>. The format of the back buffer used by
DirectX. This is the color format of the pixels. The higher the better
the quality, but not all formats might be supported.

<i>Depth buffer bits</i>. The amount of bits per pixel in the depth
buffer. The higher the number, the less chance of objects being rendered
overlapping while they're not. Not all modes might supported.

<i>Size correction</i>. Corrects misalignments between the image and the
wireframe lines over it.

<i>Color dithering</i>. Reduces color banding when downscaling colors,
at the cost of some additional noise.

<i>Texture filtering</i>. This improved the texture quality, mainly under
high angles. It will make the textures appear less blocky and pixelated.
The higher the settings, the better the quality, but also the lower the
performance.

<i>Face culling</i>. Speeds up rendering by making all the backsides of
faces invisible.

<i>High floating point precision</i>. Enabled high precision in floating
point calculations. Setting this increases rendering accuracy, but also
degrades performance.

<i>Disable desktop composition</i>. On some systems, the desktop
composition feature may corrupt the rendered viewport. Enable this
option to automatically disable the desktop composition feature when a
viewport opens.

<i>Workaround for GDI</i>. Some systems allows direct GDI drawing onto
rendered viewports. More modern systems do not support this anymore.
