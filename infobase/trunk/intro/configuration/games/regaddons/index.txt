Addons are QuArK .qrk data storing files.

These files can be found in various locations of the QuArK folders
and most do not need to be registered, that is done automatically by QuArK when the program is started.

But there are times that the registration process for an addon needs to be done by hand, such in the case
of a particular games mod.qrk file or a newly created
<a href="intro.mapeditor.misctools.html#templates">Templates list .qrk file</a>.

The process starts by clicking on QuArK's main
<a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html">Options menu</a> and selecting
<a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#optionsmenu">Configuration...</a>

This will bring up the <g>Configuration</g> dialog window that you see, in part, to the right.

Using its scroll bar move down to the <b>Games</b> section and click on the game you wish to add the
addon to. In this case we are selecting <b>Quake 2</b>.

Near the top of the Quake 2 <b>Game Settings</b> section you will see the <b>Add-ons...</b> icon button.

Click on that button to open the next dialog window called <b>Game Configuration</b>.

Near the bottom of that window you will see the text button <b>Add...</b> click on that button.

This will cause a third dialog window to open entitled <b>Add...</b> which will load and display all of the
.qrk files that are available for that game, some of which may already be registered and in use.

Now click on the .qrk addon file that you wish to select and that file name will become highlighted as
shown to the right for the <b>Quake 2Templates.qrk</b> file.

At the bottom of the <b>Add...</b> window, click the <b>Ok</b> button to accept your selection and
register it with QuArK.

The process is now complete as you can now see the addon displayed in the <b>Game Configuration</b>
dialog window shown in the last image below.

As a final step, click all of the <b>Ok</b> buttons on the remaining opened windows to close them
and return to the editor.

Just as a final note, you might have noticed the <b>Output directories...</b> icon button,<br>
just under the <b>Add-ons...</b> button, in the top screen shot.

Click on that button to see the settings for that games <b>Current output configuration</b> which
is where all of the files that QuArK produces during a map <g>build</g> will be located.

There are also other options and information on that page relating to the creation of .<g>pak</g> files,
which is another way of storing the game file so that they may be shared with others that have that game.
