Now, start Steam and login to your Steam Account - Online / Offline
the first few times it is better to have an internet connection running.

Half-Life 2 does strange things sometimes but if you know that the game runs offline there will be no internet connection required.

Select the Source SDK from your steam game menu and double click it.

Now you should see the window shown to the right. Choose your preferred game from the "Current Game:" list and click the Close button.
 
You are now ready to do the rest of your <ref>./config \ Configurations</ref> for QuArK as covered above.

<ul>
<li><u>A suggestion for people who are new to using Quark:</u>

Adding '+sv_password foo' to the Half-Life command line entry in 'configuration' will
keep people that compile a map for the first time having other people popping in to play.

It's quite a shock when you compile your first map and while looking at it, someone
else suddenly appears.

<li><u>How to insert entities in HL2 maps:</u>

Make sure you are in HL2 mode, and create a new map, then do the following:

Go to [options:configuration], and then choose Half-Life 2 under the Games section.
Where you see a button called "Add-ons", click it. You should see 3 items:
DataHL2.qrk, textures-hl2.qrk, and entities-hl2.qrk. If you don't see these,
click on "Add", and then browse on your computer to where these are
(they should be in the QuArK folder, in another folder called "addons"). After you do this, you
should see two blue cube buttons in the upper left of QuArK's window. The one on
the right should be a list of entities when you click it.

<li><u>I can't see the textures inside QuArK for Half-life 2, what is wrong?</u>

There can be many problems , here are somethings you can do.

<li>1: The account name must be written in lower case only. User = user.  - Reported by Matrikular
<li>2: Close QuArK and close Steam. Load Steam again, let it do its thing, and then start QuArK
<li>3: SDK content needs to be installed, from Steam. See <ref>./important</ref>.

<li><u>Everything was working perfectly, but then Steam did an update and I cant use QuArK anymore?</u>

Refresh the Source SDK files, as described above in the <ref>./important</ref> section. If that doesn't work,
delete the SDK content folder, and let Steam reload them.

<li><u>QuArK says, it can load some basic models, but where are they?</u>

Go to addons folders, and plugins. Add the one called 'Half-life 2 models'.

<li><u>When I adjust the scale of a brush instead of following the grid snap
I'm finding its adding an extra unit proportionally to the size
of the brush (e.g. +64.02, rather than +64)?</u>

You most likely have forced the grid into a custom setting, simply change it manually back to 64.
</ul>
