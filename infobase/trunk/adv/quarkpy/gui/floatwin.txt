title: Floating Windows
author: Tiglari

A QuArK dialog box is just a restricted kind of floating
window; so now it's time to look into the code that
defines them and see how floating windows work in general.

dialog boxes are defined as a class in quarkpy.qmacro;
the definition starts out like this:

<code>
class dialogbox:

    dlgdef = ""
    size = (300,170)
    begincolor = None
    endcolor = None
    name = None
    dfsep = 0.6
    dlgflags = qutils.FWF_KEEPFOCUS | qutils.FWF_POPUPCLOSE
</code>

Here we're just providing default values for the various
things that can be defined when a more specific type of
dialog is created as a subclass.

Now comes the most important method of this class, its
constructor (which we have already invoked as part of the
constructor of the texture multiplier dialag):

<code>
    def __init__(self, form, src, **buttons):
        name = self.name or self.__class__.__name__
        closedialogbox(name)
        f = quarkx.newobj("Dlg:form")
        f.loadtext(self.dlgdef)
</code>

The first three parameters are self-explanatory (if you've
read through dialogs.txt), the last is the magic for dealing
with the buttons, don't worry about it now.  Next we derive
a name for the box, and close any already opened one with the
same name (closedialogbox() is defined elsewhere in
quarkpy.qmacro).  And now something interesting happens;
we create an actual form object, and then load in whatever
text has wound up assigned to dlgdef.  loadtext is actually
one of the methods of QObjects (QuArK internal objects);
it would not be amiss to look it up in Quarkx.rtf.

And so here's our next chunk of code:

<code>
        self.f = f
        for pybtn in f.findallsubitems("", ':py'):
            pybtn["sendto"] = name
        self.buttons = buttons
        dlg = form.newfloating(self.dlgflags, f["Caption"])
</code>

The first line simply stores the form we've made as a data
member of the dialog, the next three are button-processing
magic, and finally we create our new floating window.
If you look up newfloating() in quarkx.rtf, you'll see that
it's a method of window objects (the one that was passed
as the form argument), which takes as first argument
a bunch of flags, and second a string to use as a caption.
f["Caption"] is just an instance of the syntax whereby
the value of a specific ("Caption") of a QObject (f), is
fetched, so the net result is that whatever we put
in as value of the Caption specific of the dlgdef gets
passed to the new floating window as its caption.

Next comes assorted housekeeping.

<code>
        dialogboxes[name] = dlg
        dlg.windowrect = self.windowrect()
        if self.begincolor is not None: dlg.begincolor = self.begincolor
        if self.endcolor is not None: dlg.endcolor = self.endcolor
        dlg.onclose = self.onclose
        dlg.info = self
        self.dlg = dlg
        self.src = src
</code>

dialogboxes is a global variable of quarkpy.qmacros, so this
registers our current dialog box as one that is open.
Next we set the dimensions of  the new floating window
(check the qmacro code for how windowrect() works), and attach
various further data members to the floating window and the
dialog box object.  It would be good to look up the things
attributed to dlg (the floating window) in Quarkx.rtf.

But a warning about some terminological confustion:  windows
sometimes get called `forms' and are thereby subject to betting
confuse with :form objects, but these are inherently
different!

And now some more interesting stuff:

<code>
        df = dlg.mainpanel.newdataform()
        self.df = df
        df.header = 0
        df.sep = self.dfsep
</code>

 When floating windows are created, they automatically
 get a panel, which is accessed as `mainpanel'.  And
 then a panel's newdataform() method will create a new
 dataform in the panel, the first line gives us the dataform
 df, a child of the window dlg's main panel.  So we've
 now built the three-level structure mentioned at the
 beginning of the dialogs tutorial.  Now we set some
 dataform attributes; setting the header to 0 supresses
 the `specific' and `arg' headers that you see at the top
 of the columns when entity specifics are displayed in
 the multi-page panel, then the dfsep attribute of the
 dialog object is applied to the dataform, where it does
 its real work.

 And finally comes the essential setdata method:

<code>
        df.setdata(src, f)
</code>

This establishes the connection between the screen and the
src object we created earlier.  The contents of src are
displayed in the dataform df, in accordance with the layout
specified in the form f.  And we conclude with a few more
details:

<code>
        df.onchange = self.datachange
        df.flags = 8   # DF_AUTOFOCUS
        dlg.show()
</code>

The onchange method of a dataform is a method that gets
executed when the data is changed.  So if you want something
to happen whenever the data is changed, as in the texture
positioning dialog or the `slider' dialog (mapslide), you
organize this, for a dialog box, by providing a datachange
method.  The flags determine aspects of the presentation
of the dataform, the available ones are:

<code>
# dataform flags
DF_LOCAL        = 1    # prevents screen flashes if changes in this box don't affect anything else
DF_AUTOFOCUS    = 8    # gets focus when mouse cursor enters
</code>

And finally, the last line makes it show up on the screen;
in GUI programming, things are normally kept hidden until
their finished being built, to make things look polished.

So here are the remaining methods:

<code>
    def datachange(self, df):
        pass   # abstract

    def onclose(self, dlg):
        dlg.info = None
        dlg.onclose = None   # clear refs
        if self.df is not None:
            self.df.onchange = None
            self.df = None
        self.dlg = None
        del self.buttons

    def close(self, reserved=None):
        self.dlg.close()
</code>

datachange is defined here in a content-free manner so that
there's something to be assigned as the df's onchange method,
regardless of whether it's really needed or not.  The
onclose method sets lots of things to None, in order to
prevent circular references from causing memory leaks (see
the discussion in Quarkx.rtf).  You should have noticed
the lines whereby these are passed as callbacks to the
floating window and the dataform.  close() on the other
hand, is not a callback, but calls the floating window's
own close() method.

Once you understand how dialog boxes are built, you can
meddle with them in various ways; so in quarkpy.dlgclasses.py
there is defined placepersistent_dialogbox, which remembers
where it was last opened (basically by fiddling with
windowrect()).  And from that is defined LiveEditDlg,
which is specialized for controlling things that move in
the views as you change the data.

And dialog boxes are far from being the only kind of
floating window, the face flags window that is obtained
for Q2 engine games by RMB|Texture Flags|Flags ...
is a substantially different one.  Its code is produced
by the MapLayout.flagsclick method in quarkpy.mapgr.

I won't go over it in detail but just mention a few things.
This window doesn't just appear for a while and vanish
when you change the selection, but persists, and fills
up with appropriate face flag data whenever you select
something that has faces.

The setup code is bracketted by some bookkeeping that
makes sure that there's only one face flags window
open at any one time, and then it gets its form from
the .qrk files, by code which has the effect that
the last .qrk to load that defines a TextureFlag form
is the one whose TextureFlag form gets used (so an
addon for a game would overrule the basic data for the
game).  Note that `flist[-1]' designates the last element
of flist (think of flist as a circular list, first element
being 0).

Things should look routine until:

<code>
            df.actionchanging = 596
</code>

Part of the df magic is that if a dataform changes
any QObject that comes from a file, this change is
registered in the undo mechanism, and the actionchanging
number is the index of the undo string, defined in
quarkpy.qdictionnary.

So things burble along thru:

<code>
        self.loadfaceflags(form)
        ff.show()
</code>

ff.show()?  Well remember that ff is a floating window, not
a dialog object, and windows are shown.  ff probably for
`floating form', because of the window/form terminology
confusion mentioned earlier.

And we should be able to guess that loadfaceflags is the
function that's going to load the face data into ff's
dataform, under the control of the TextureFlags form.
And if you look at its definition, it's clear that it does
this, except there's a bit of a surprise at the end:

<code>
        df.setdata(self.loadtfflist(), form)
</code>

When you look at loadtfflist(), you find a rather
complicated function!  Which, in brief, is doing this:
The faces in the current selection are gathered into a list.
Then the names of the textures in the list are made to be
keys for a dictionary, whose values are the textures,
and each member of the face list flist is replaced by
a pair with the original member first and its texture
second.  And that's what's returned to be the first argument
of setdata.

Which is thereby revealed to be even more subtle than
suggested so far: it can operate on many objects at once,
and display in the form default information provided from
a default object rather than the thing being edited itself.

Here's what it says in <ref> src/quarkx </ref>:

<code>
setdata(objs) setdata(objs, formobj):
</code>
<ul>
<li>Select the object(s) whose Specifics/Args are to be
  displayed in the data form. objs can be either a single
  " objspec " or a list of " objspecs ". An " objspec " i
  either a single object or a tuple of two objects : the
  actual object and another one with default values.
  If a Specific is not found in the object, the data
  form displays the one from its default value. The
  optional argument formobj gives a :form Internal object
  to use.
</ul>

So for example for a face, if the face doesn't have
some property but the face's texture specifies a default
for that property, the default will be shown in the window.
And, automagically, if you edit the specific, the change
will be registered undoably in all of the (non-default)
objects that have been presented to setdata.  Whew.

So, finally, how does the form load with data for a new
face when the selection changes?  Via this method
of MapLayout:

<code>
    def selchange(self):
        if self.faceflags is not None:
            self.loadfaceflags()
        self.mpp.resetpage()
</code>

To finish off, a bit more about panels.  Panels can contain
more than one control, by being divided into sections.
To see how it's done, study panels in Quarkx.rtf, and
look at plugins/map3viewslayout.py, which is quite well
commented.  The basic idea is to divide panels into sectons
with statements like:

<code>
        self.mainpanel.sections = ((), (0.4,))
</code>

Which says one column, two rows with the top taking up
40% of the space, and:

<code>
        self.ViewXY = self.mainpanel.newmapview()
        self.ViewXY.section = (0,1)
</code>

Which creates a map view (another kind of control) in the
main panel, and then puts it in the first column (there's
only one) of the lower row.  Then the code goes on to put
a panel in the upper row, and put two more map views into
that.
