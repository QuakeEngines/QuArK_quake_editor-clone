title: GUI Window Basics
author: Tiglari

Since one reason for getting involved in QuArK development
is to learn something about GUI (Graphical User Interface)
programming, I thought I'd start at the beginning - if you want
to learn it, you probably don't know it already.  People with
GUI experience will want to skip this.

One of the fundamental ideas of GUI programs is 'window'.
is a region (typically a rectangle) on the screen that is
looked after by some code. The job of this code is to;

<ol>
<li>draw the window's region, typically in different ways depending on what's going on at the time.
<li>respond to events that occur when the mouse cursor is in the window's region.
</ol>

So a 'button' is a little window that draws a picture that
looks something like a button in an 'up position', but if
a mouse-button is pressed down while the mouse cursor is in
the window, the picture will change to that of a button
in a down position, and some additional code will get
executed that does whatever pressing the button is supposed
to accomplish.

These windows are arranged in a vast familial hierarchy:
an 'application' (main program) has a main window which
has as 'child windows' all of the other windows that the
application throws up.  So for example when the application
is closed, a shut-down message is sent to its children,
and so on to their children, so if everything is correctly
coded, all the windows will vanish from the screen.
Likewise windows can 'delegate' tasks to their parents,
for example an 'edit window' in a dialog box can delegate
processing of an ESC or Enter keypress to its parent
dialog box, to close the dialog and throw away or record
the results of the dialog.

Happily for the Python coder, Delphi code manages all of the
details of this, but it's probably good to have at least
this much of an idea of what's going on under the hood.
