.qrk files are just QObjects stored in files.  There are actually
two kinds of .qrk files, text and binary (both unfortunately with
the extension .qrk).  The text files can be read an edited with
a text-editor (although the format is initially forbidding), whereas
the binaries are much more compact, and allow `delay loading'
which helps QuArK manage big ones with less chugging.

To get a text version of a binary *.qrk, just open it, and save then save
it (as `structured text', with the extension .txt to keep the file system
happy).  The `technical info' zips for the older QuArK versions,
and the current development snapshots, contain the
text versions of the *.qrk files, which furthermore tend to contain useful
information such as comments on the syntax, etc.

A (text format) .Qrk begins with the line `QQRKSRC1', which says
that it's a QuArK text format file.  Then there can be comment
lines beginning with `//' (everything after `//' on a line is
igored), whitespace and blank lines etc. until we get down to
business with a line whose first nonblack character is:

  '{'.

'{' opens a QObject.  We already know that QObjects have two
`Specifics' (name-value pairs), and `Subitems', which are
QObjects which will have a `name' specific.  So it's not too
surprising that the rest of a QObject will consist of a series
of pairs:

<code>
  &lt;Name> = &lt;Value>
</code>

  (where &lt;Value> can be as large an expanse of text as you like,
   if it's a great big QOobject)

Until we fetch up at the end with the closing `}', after which the
file must end.

So let's look at the beginning of the Portal of Praevus add-on
(I started as a Hexen II entity guy, so we gotta have some Hx2
content here ...)

<code>
QQRKSRC1
// This file has been written by QuArK Version 5.0.b5
// It's the text version of file: Praevus.qrk
// Portal of Praevus add-on by tiglari@hexenworld.com
//   to be added on to datah2.qrk (data file for Hexen II)
//
// The Textures need to be further subsorted into wall, floor/ceiling,
//  button, etc; if you want to do this please do, it's not rocket
//  science!

{
  QuArKProtected = "1"
  Description = "Portal of Praevus Data"

    praevus directory infos.qctx =
    {
        Game = "Hexen II"
        SourceDir = "PORTALS"
//      GameDir = "fortress"
    }
</code>

After the opening guff, we see that the first specific is
`QuArKProtected'. This will cause a warning to pop up whenever QuArK
tries to save/overwrite this file (only use this if the file is
considered part of QuArK).  'QuArKProtected''s value is a string, enclosed
in quotes.  There are several other schemes for representing values, such
as Hex codes, which we'll get into shortly.

Then comes our first subelement.  Its Name specific will be
`praevus directory infos.qctx'.  Its shortname is `praevus directory infos'
and its extension is .qctx, so it's a Quake Context, and modifies
how things are done (here where to look for info about the game).
This particular QObject has two ordinary string-specifics,
and then ends.  So it goes on with more subelements until the final
'}' on line 6108.

So that's the basic idea, but there is a bit more to it than that.

First, in addition to strings, there are several additional types of
specific-values.  Binary data is introduced with `$'.  So for example
the line from the Defaults.qrk file prescribing the red default
color for tags is:

<code>
  Tag        = $FF0000
</code>

(a standard <g>RGB</g> color code, for those new to such things)

Multiline strings can be specified as sequences of ordinary "-bounded
strings separated by `$0D':

<code>
  Hint = "This ought to work"
      $0D"  if it doesn't, why not try extreme skiing?"
</code>

And sequences of numbers are bounded by ', a bounding box for example
might be specified as:

<code>
     bbox = '-8 -8 -8 8 8 8'
</code>

All this and some more stuff that I haven't seen exemplified is
prescribed in the function ConstructObjsFromText
in the file QkFileObject.

* sections on the major components of the major kinds of .qrk file would go nicely here *

<strong>Forms:</strong>
 For game supporters, one of the most important kinds of components
 of .qrk files are :forms, since these control how the specifics
 of entities are entered into maps.  :forms are also important
 in Python coding, since they are used to control in making dialog
 boxes, etc.

 To get a sense of how it goes, here's the beginning of the entity
 forms specifications from DATAH2.QRK:

<code>
   Entity forms.qctx =
   {  // ENTFRM
     Ring_Flight:form =
     {
      Help = "Ring of Flight"
      bbox = '-8 -8 -44 8 8 20'
      mdl = "models/ringft.mdl"
     more: = {
       Typ="B"
       Txt="triggering"
       Cap="Push"
       Form="item_triggers:form"
       Hint="specifics for triggering when item is taken"
     }
      spawnflags: =
        {Txt="&"
         Typ="X1"
         Cap="FLOAT"
         Hint="item doesn't drop to floor when spawned  "}
     }
     Ring_Regeneration:form =
     { ...
     ....
</code>

Entity Forms is a Quake Context, its subitems are a (big) list of
:form objects.  These have some specifics (all QObjects, regardless
of type, can have specifics freely added to them), and then comes
a list of subitems.  Each subitem is a little window, `control'
or `widget' (GUI geekspeak) whereby some attribute of the entity
can be set by the editor.  I need to call them something, so I'll
call them `fields'.

The way fields work is a bit devious.  They have names like `more:',
`spawnflags:', etc. (colon, null extension). Then inside the brackets are
listed further specifics, of which the most important is `Typ'.  Typ
determines what kind of control is used; X1 for example is a checkbox that
sets the first bit position (flag) in an integer.  Usually the name
determines what attribute of the entity is being set, so the `spawnflags'
subitem sets the the first bit position of the `spawnflags' attribute of
the entity.  But not always; `more:' above is just a label.

Another important specific of fields is `Txt'.  This is the `label'
that appears to the left of the data-entry widget itself.  If it's
"&", then the name of the field is used as the label, so if you look
at entity specifics in the map editor, you'll see the name of the
various entity attributes on the left, their values on the right
(in the data-entry widgets).  Their are various further field specifics,
"Cap" for additional text (appearing on the right) and "Hint",
for flyover hints, and whatever more the delphi code for that
kind of Typ happends to support.  So the :more button calls up
an additional window for entering further specifics, its form is
given as the value of the Form specific.

Unfortunately, there is no solid list of all the Typs (programmers
might like to know that they're defined in a big cascade of
Case statements in prog/FormCfg.pas:TFormCfg..wmMessageInterne;
once you've got the hang of it, it's not too hard to add new ones,
without fully understanding everything that's going on).  Browsing
in the text versions of the game support files, especially dataq2.qrk,
is a way to get started learning them.

 * A guide to Typ's would also be nice to have *
