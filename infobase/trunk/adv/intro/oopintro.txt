title: Understanding OOP
author: Tiglari/cdunde

1. Intro

OOP, or object-oriented programming, is a programming methodology
developed in the 70s that became popular in the 80s for building
large and complex programs, such as especially GUI applications,
of which QuArK is a fine instance.  Popular OOP languages include
C++, Java, Object Pascal/Delphi and Python.  There are both subtle
and obvious differences between the approaches taken by all of these
languages, but there is also a lot of commonality, such that someone
already familiar with OOP from the first three mentioned languages
can probably pick up what they need to know about Python OOP from
the documentation and QuArK code.

2.  Basic Objects

An object is basically a chunk of the computer's memory that has been
organized to provide storage for some data, and methods for
changing it and reading it.  So it's like a 'struct' in C,
or a 'record' in Pascal, but more powerful.  For a simple example
that's not totally irrelevant to a geometry-managing program such
as QuArK, suppose we have circles to manage.  A circle can be
characterized by the three coordinates of its center, and by its
radius:

<code>
  class Circle:
      x = 1
      y = 0
      z = 5
      r = 1.5
</code>

(Important: watch your letters, they are case sensitive.)

Or you can just create the object by writing:

<code>
  class Circle:
      pass
</code>

and add the data later:

<code>
  Circle.x = 1
  Circle.y = 0
  Circle.z = 5
  Circle.r = 1.5
</code>
The '.' separates the name of the class itself from its 'attributes'.

Whichever you've done, you can get the data back later (Delphi users
take note: there's no 'with' statement, since Guido van Rossum, Python's
creator, finds them harmful to programs' maintainability).  So if
either of the above is in a file 'circles.py', in the Python
interpreter you can write:
<code>
>>> import plugins.circles         [you type]
>>> plugins.circles.Circle.r       [ditto]
1.5                        [Python answers]
</code>

Note that Python is <strong>much</strong> more liberal than C++,
Object Pascal/Delphi, or Java, since in these languages you'd have
to declare your object as belonging to a 'type', and say what kinds
of 'data members' it could have, in advance of using it.

This rather minimalistic sort of class has its uses (for example
as a package for passing bundles of data round in the 'live edit dialog'
facility (LiveEditDlg in quarkpy.dlgclasses), but to make classes
really worthwhile several closely related new ideas are needed, first
instances and methods, and later, inheritance.

2. Methods and Instances

A method is basically a function, closely associated with an object,
for doing something involving its data (adding data, reading it,
performing some calculation involving it and returning the result,
or whatever).   For example having created a circle, we might
want to access its circumference and area; the idea is that
we'll write things like
<code>
answer =  plugins.circle.circumference()
</code>
(plugins because that is the folder in which the circles.py file will be located.)

(Parentheses because this is going to be produced by a kind of function,
and functions are marked in Python by parentheses.)

But to do this in a sensible way we need to distinguish two slightly
different notions, 'circle' as a particular object, and 'circle' as
a template for making objects.  Different circles will have different
centers and radii, but use the same method to make them.  So we need a way to
define both a template and a method for making things that fit it.  Templates
for objects are what 'classes' are really supposed to be, and the methods
for making particular objects, 'instances', are called 'constructors'.

In Python, constructors all have the same name, '__init__': the double
underscores on either side are a signal that something with special
meaning for Python is involved.  All methods, including constructors,
are defined as functions internal to the class, so their definitions
start with 'def'.  And these functions have 'self' as their first
argument, which always refers to the object (being created, if the
function is a constructor).  So the revised definition for the circle
class might look like this:
<code>
import math

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, x, y, z, r):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z
        self.radius = r
        
    def circumference(self):
        return self.radius*math.pi
        
    def radius(self):
        return self.radius
</code>
The constructor <b>attaches</b> the three coordinates and the radius as
'data members' of the object <b>self</b> it creates, and there are two methods
to write this; the second is included to help people who can't remember whether
to write circle.radius or circle.radius() (pretty much anybody who's
focused on content rather than punctuation).  We've used uppercase
for the name of our class, in accord with a sensible but not always
obeyed convention to use uppercase to start 'template' names,
lowercase for 'instance names'.

At this point, we have completed the creation of our class.
Because we write this code in a text editor we need to save it as a
Python file, in this case as 'circles.py', and include 'import math'
(because we have used its <b>pi</b> function in our 'def circumference')
in front of the 'circles' definition, before we save it. We then need to
move the 'circles.py' file to the plugins folder. As a matter of good
coding practice, the 'import' and 'from' statements are usually grouped
together at the beginning of the Python file.

At this point we could continue to add more code, to this file, to apply
(or use) the 'class Circle' and its definitions we just created, or we can
create another Python 'plugin' file and 'import circles' to there, which is
what we will do now just to demonstrate how files can pass data and functions.

So we will now write another simple 'plugin' Python file (and save that to the
plugins folder as well) with the following code to see the effect of the
Circle class in the circles.py file:
<code>
import quarkpy.qmacro   # to bring in qmacro functions we need
import quarkx           # to bring in quarkx functions we need
from circles import *   # to bring in all of our circle class

def printcir(self):
    circle = Circle(1,0,3,1.5)  # assigns values to the attributes
    circle.circumference()      # passes the values to circle class
    answer = circle.circumference()  # collects the 'return' data
    print answer                # prints the answer to the console
</code>
This will pass the three coordinates of 1,0,3 (for x,y,z) and
the radius of 1.5 to the Circle class which will process it then
'return' the 'answer' of 4.71238898038 that will be printed to the console.

But before we can save this file, we need to add some code to create a
menu item, that we can use to activate (or call) the 'printcir' function:
<code>
def WindowClick(self):
    import quarkpy.mapoptions   # brings in the 'Options' menu
    printcir(self)              # calls our function
    quarkx.console(1)           # brings the console into view

quarkpy.mapoptions.items.append(quarkpy.qmenu.item("&Print Cir.", 
WindowClick)) # adds it to the 'Options' menu
</code>
Now we can save this 'plugin' file as well, calling it something like ' mapcircles.py ',
to the plugins folder. You can either cut-n-paste these scripts to a text editor
to create your own files as we have discussed, or use the ones provided here,
<a href="zips">OOP_examples.zip</a>, of working examples for this tutorial (and others)
in the 'zips' sub-folder of your QuArK-help folder on your hard drive.

For a concrete example of some rather basic classes, look at the
two kinds of menu items defined in quarkpy.qmenu, 'item', and 'popup'.
These classes have only constructors, and no other methods, and all
the constructors do is attach the same parameters as data members,
and add in some extra default stuff, such as 'normal' as a value
of 'state'.    Note that functions, such as 'onclick'. can be attached
to objects by constructors (but these aren't methods).


3. Inheritance

The final thing we need for a real OOP system is inheritance, which
is basing classes on other classes.  In a real geometry-managing
program we'd have lots of different shapes, with various features.
For example points wouldn't have radius or circumference (perhaps),
but they would have a 'center' or 'origin', like all other figures.
So we might define:

<code>
class Figure:
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z
        
    def origin(self):
        return self.x, self.y, self.z
</code>
Now we might want at least two 'derived classes', or 'subclasses', Point
and Circle, so we might write something like this:
<code>
class Point(Figure):
    pass

class Circle(Figure):
    def __init__(self, x, y, z, r):
        Figure.__init__(self, x, y, z)
        self.radius = r
        
    def circumference(self):
        return self.radius*math.pi
        
    def radius(self):
        return self.radius
</code>
The Point class is strictly cosmetic: there's a sensible opinion to the
effect that subclasses ought to be more specialized than their parents,
not just different (golden lab is a good subclass of dog, but not of cat).
Circles aren't kinds of points, but the point class doesn't add anything
to our Figure concept (at least yet).  So we define it as a subclass
of Figure with no new content; note that the 'base class' <b>(Figure)</b>
is put in parentheses.

A derived class 'inherits' all methods and data members from its parent, so we
can write something like:
<code>
>>>from Figures import *
>>>point = Point(1,1,1)
>>>point.origin()
</code>
and get
<code>
(1,1,1)
</code>
in reply.

In addition to being inherited, methods (and data members) can be 'overridden':
if the derived class defines a method or data member with the same name as
one of the parent class, then the definition in the derived class is normally
used rather than in the parent, for instances of the derived class.  This is
illustrated with the second constructor __init__() of class Circle with the code
line of Figure.__init__(self, x, y, z) as shown above in the script.

However, sometimes we need to get at the parent method, which is also illustrated
in this constructor: when one name is put in front of another with '.', we say
that the first name is a qualifier of the second.  So to get at the parent's definition,
we qualify the method name with the name of the parent class, but when we do
this we have to provide the 'self' argument explicitly.  Indeed, any method of
any class can be used in this way, qualifying it with the class name and providing
the first argument.

So what is the difference between a method and a function that just happens to
have been attached to an object, such as the onclick function for qmenu.item?
First, only methods participate in inheritance, and second, only methods can be
called via the shortcut technique with an instance as qualifier, and automatically
supplied as first argument (but you could write something like Circle.circumference(mycircle)
instead of mycircle.circumference(), if you wanted to).

Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any really simple example of a base class
and some subclasses in the QuArK code.  Some important ones are the dialog boxes,
base class dialogbox in quarkpy.qmacro, and the handles, base class GenericHandle
in qhandles.py.  But there's lots of stuff in them.  An example of a subclass of
dialogbox is SimpleCancelDlgBox defined in quarkpy.qeditor; you can find further
subclasses of SimpleCancelDlgBox by searching for 'CancelDlgBox)' (the final
parenthesis picks up that it's being used as a base class in a class statement).
There is much more to Python classes than this; it wouldn't be a bad idea to
look over the classes section in the tutorial, although there's a fair amount
of stuff that wouldn't make much sense to beginners (but also some reasonably 
straightforward examples.

4.  Classes, Builtin types and Extension types.

There's one more basic topic that really has to be covered, which is the difference
between classes, builtin types, and extension types.  Classes are the things we've
just covered, whereas builtin types are the basic types such as int, string etc.
provided by Python.  A basic difference between them is that you can't add random
new stuff to a builtin type.  For example, if you write:
<code>
myinteger = 2
myinteger.tag = 'this cool one I just invented'
</code>
you'll get an error, whereas:
<code>
mycircle = Circle(0,0,0,3)
mycircle.tag= 'this cool one I just invented'
</code>
will work fine (assuming you've imported the definition of Circle, etc.).

Extension types are types which have been defined in extensions to Python, which in
the case of QuArK Python will have been written in Delphi.  Some important extension
types for QuArK Python are vector and qobject, created by calls such as:
<code>
myvector = quarkx.vect(1, 0, 10)
face = quarkx.newobj("top:f")
</code>
Like classes, extension types have methods (followed by ()) and data members
(not followed by ()), but unlike classes, and like builtin types, you can't
attach random stuff to them. (Note: in recent versions of Python, these differences
have been largely eliminated, but rewriting QuArK to take advantage of this would
be a major enterprise).  The various extension classes that Delphi provides
to QuArK Python are described in the quarkx section of the infobase.

An especially noteworthy feature is, that the QObject type in particular is
defined by means of a rather large Delphi class hierarchy; Delphi classes are
also OOP, but different in various ways from Python.  The 'suffixes' to the string
argument passed to quarkx.newobj (":f", ":b", etc.) determine what Delphi type
is used to make the instance of the extension class, and this then determines what
data members and methods are available from Python (e.g. .normal is available for
faces (suffix ":f"), but not polys (suffix ":p").
