title: Plugin Tutorial
subdir: blather command tagging help display mouse

In this tutorial we slowly construct an oversimplified
version of the maptagside plugin.
A significant general point is that these tutorials don't
represent the maptagside plugin as it actually is, but rather
what I currently think it should have been.  It uses some
Java-style coding conventions, such as initial caps for
classes and lowercase for functions & variables.

The actual maptagside plugin is a sprawling mess, since it
was my first, & embodies many errors in design.  Perhaps
I will clean it up some day, but otoh, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it.
