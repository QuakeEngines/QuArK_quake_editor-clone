title: Basics

Once again we will be redefining a method (the one that produces
the speed menus), but the technique is different again because
of the way the relevant classes are set up.  Speed menus are
handled by methods associated with various kinds of classes
descended from EntityManager, defined in the quarkpy file
mapentities.py.  These classes have no instances, which will
lead to a bit of black magic later on.  The class for faces is
FaceType

What we'll be doing is defining a new menu function for
FaceType, which will add our new stuff onto the right mouse menu
for faces.  What stuff? Well, always, a Tag Side command, but if
a side is tagged, we will also want a Glue to Tagged command,
and for a final flourish, let's say that if the face we're
looking at is the original one, the only option we want is to
Clear the tag.

Here is a basic format for adding things to the face menu:
<code>
def tagmenu(o, editor, oldfacemenu = quarkpy.mapentities.FaceType.menu.im_func):
    "the new right-mouse for sides"
    menu = oldfacemenu(o, editor)
    &lt;add stuff to menu&gt;
    return menu
</code>
<code>
quarkpy.mapentities.FaceType.menu = tagmenu
</code>
The `im_func' and the end of the `def' line is the black magic;
it is needed to refer to
a method of a class with no instances.

Now to add stuff to the menu we could in fact just add the menu
items we already have, getting something like this:
<code>
def tagmenu(o, editor, oldfacemenu = quarkpy.mapentities.FaceType.menu.im_func):
    "the new right-mouse for sides"
    menu = oldfacemenu(o, editor)
    menu = [mentagside, menglueside, menclearside]+menu
    return menu
</code>
These menu-building functions take two arguments, the
object they're called by RMB-ing on, and the editor.  And
we pass the older form of the menu function, which this one
replaces, as a default parameter.
