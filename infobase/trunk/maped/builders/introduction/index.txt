title: Introduction

There are currently shape builders for making arches,
caps and bevels out of either brushes or patches, and
also stairways.


They are also for the moment introduced into maps by RMB
(Right Mouse Button) clicking on an appropriate shaped
(six-sided, boxy) brush in a map-view, and then selecting
a menu item such as `Curves', `Brush Curves' or `Stair'
from near the top of the speed menu that then appears.

If the RMB menu items for the shape builders are disabled (greyed out,
doing nothing), it may be because the code is doesn't think it
knows how to use the brush as a basis for a shape (wrong number
of sides, crazy angles, etc); a comment about this
might appear in the help window called up by F1.

What the RMB command actually does is create a `duplicator'
(a sophisticated QuArK feature that creates shapes from data,
on the basis of code in plugins) containing the original brush.
So if we make a <act>Brush Curve | Arch</act> for example what we get looks
like this in the treeview:

Features of the shape can then be further specified by setting
specifics for the duplicator, and it can be dynamically
resized by selecting the brush and dragging its faces.

Two further points:
<UL>
<LI> No CSG operations should be performed on the brushes used by the
shape-builders. The brushes need to be six-sided, CSG operations will mess this
up and break them.

Watch out for items other than the shape-defining brush getting into the
duplicator (as in this screenie here, where a light has wandered in) such
intruders won't appear in the map or the map views, & might mess things up.  If
something you have inserted disappears when it's not selected, it might have
gotten stuck inside a shape-builder.
