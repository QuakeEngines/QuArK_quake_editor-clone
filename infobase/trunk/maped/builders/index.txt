title: Shape Builders
subdir: introduction archcap brusharchcap bevel column

Shape-builders are a method for building complex objects,
such as arches, stairways and more, on the basis
of a boxy, 6-faced brush that gives the general dimensions
of the object, plus additional specifics for details.

The most useful shape-builders are probably the ones for
patch based arches (for Q3-engine games) and brush-based
arches (earlier games), so these are discussed first, and
most extensively.
