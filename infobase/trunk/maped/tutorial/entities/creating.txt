To create a entity in QuArK, you choose it from either the
<ref> intro/mapeditor/userdata \ prefabs / userdata panel</ref> or by clicking
on the <tt>new item</tt> icon which will bring up the
<ref> intro/mapeditor/misctools/newmapitem \ New map items...</ref> window,
from where you also can choose between the different entities.

Let's try it out. Create a <tt>info_player_start</tt> point-entity, by clicking
on the <tt>new item</tt> icon, and find the entity in the folder named
something like 'Player starts'. Then double-click on it, to bring it into the
map.

Some of the point-entities have a <g>bounding-box</g>. This usually indicates,
that the monster, player or 3D-model is that large, and the point-entity should
not be embedded (either partly or whole) into brushes, as the monster/player
will then get stuck.

As the info_player_start entity has such a bounding-box, you should carefully
place it inside your room. Make sure it does not touch any of the walls or the
floor/ceiling. You may need to
<ref> intro/mapeditor/toolpalettes/display/zoom \ zoom in </ref> and change the
<ref> intro/mapeditor/toolpalettes/display/grid \ grid size </ref> to place it
just right.

Whenever you have marked an entity, and if the entity requires it, you might
see an <tt>entity pointing angle</tt> handle, or <tt>ball-handle</tt> as some
call it. This will allow you to quickly control in what direction the entity
should face, or move at. The ball-handle can be set in these positions; 0-360
degrees (0-360), upwards (-1) or downwards (-2), all depending on the game.

When you create a <tt>brush-entity</tt>, QuArK will automatically create a new
brush and assign it to the newly created entity.

If you do not want that brush, you can <tt>expand</tt> the brush-entity object
in the tree-view, by clicking on the little
<img width=11 height=11 align=absmiddle>image23b.png</img> icon (Just like in
Windows' File-explorer), then select the brush in the brush-entity and delete
it.

This is also the way to add more brushes to a brush-entity. The entity has to
be expanded, or empty (not having brushes assigned to it), for you to be able
to drag and drop a brush into it. All this can only be done in the
<ref> intro/mapeditor/dataforms/treeview </ref>.
