When you start the map-editor using the icon described, a default room will be
presented for you. This you can use to test to see if the build-programs works,
by issuing a <tt>QuickGO!</tt> from the game menu; which is either Quake-1,
Hexen-II, Quake-2, Heretic-II, Half-Life, etc., depending on what you have
selected in the QuArK-explorer games menu.

If you have any problems calling the build-programs, first check the
<ref> intro/basicknowledge </ref>, next the <ref> intro/configuration/games \ Configuration </ref>
then the <ref> maped/games </ref> and lastly if you simply can't get it to work,
mail your problem to the
<a href="http://quark.planetquake.gamespy.com/forums/">QuArK-forum</a>; stating
for what game you are developing, and a good description of your problem.

There are different views and panels in the map-editor, each with their
function, which you will be presented to, through this tutorial. You can also
check the <ref> intro/mapeditor \ map-editor reference pages </ref>, if
you can't wait.
