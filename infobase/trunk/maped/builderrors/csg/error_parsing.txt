Error: parsing entity 3, brush 0, side 2 : expecting '(' got '32'

Getting an error similar to the above, usually means that the .MAP file isn't in the correct format,
for the build-tool to understand.

Please check:
<ul>
<li>Are you using the correct build-tool for the correct game?<br>
    For instance, it is of no use, to have a Quake-1 build-tool compile a Quake-3:Arena .MAP file, as the
    internal structure in the Quake-3:Arena .MAP file can't be understood by the Quake-1 build-tool.
<li>Have you set up QuArK to the proper game-mode?<br>
    Make sure that you have selected the correct game-mode, for the game you want to make maps for.
<li>Did you try to convert a game-A .MAP file to a game-B .MAP file, using QuArK?<br>
    QuArK can't always do a useful conversion of .MAP files, from some game to a different game.
    When doing this, you should experiment alot to see what can and what can not work.
</ul>
