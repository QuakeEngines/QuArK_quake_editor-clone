title: Func_areaportal entities

<b>Question:</b><br>
I know that that is some kind of a barrier for Quake-2 used by the map-designer (me) to tell
Quake-2 to ignore anything that is behind it, so that the framerate will not suffer from parts of the map that are not
essential yet, but will be taken into account (and therefore use precious processing power) by Quake-2 if this func_areaportal
is not used. But how do i place it?

<b>Answer:</b><br>
Quake-2 tends to (re)draw the whole map during gameplay all the time, even the (numerous) parts
of it that are not visible to the player (yet). This of course puts a lot of "stress" on your system (pc), resulting in a
slower gameplay, more than necessary.

The func_areaportal entity tells Quake-2 to ignore anything that's behind the brush belonging to the func_areaportal.

This brush can be resized just like all the others and should be placed in a way that it covers the passage that you want to
"close off" completely. Putting the brush of the func_areaportal in the same place as the brush of, for example, the func_door
that you use to close off the corridor visibly (from the player's point of view) is the only wise choice of positioning.

Take care not to make it visible for the player; making it a little "thinner" than the door-brush prevents that. Making it
wider and/or higher than the door-brush is not bad (most of the times).

You can use the func_areaportal in conjunction with any "passage-covering-entity" like; func_train, func_plat,
func_explosive, etc.

Make sure that the TARGET specific of the entity you chose as a "passage-blocker" is pointing to the TARGETNAME specific of
the func_areaportal. This will make the brush of the func_areaportal dissapear when the entity (func_door for instance) gets
triggered (and reappear if the door slams shut again. Nifty).

Don't just give the passage-blocking-entity and the func_areaportal the same TARGETNAME. It will result in a func_areaportal
that DOES dissapear when you trigger (for example) the button that opens the door, but that DOES NOT reappear automatically
when the door slams shut again. Even worse, it will reappear when you open the door once again, showing its ugly black looks to
the confused player.

You can of course check the "relationship" between the trigger-entity, the passage-blocking-entity and the func_areaportal
by selecting one of them in QuArK.
