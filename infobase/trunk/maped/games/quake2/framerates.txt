<b>Question:</b><br>
How do I measure the "framerate",
i.e. how fast my maps are displayed by Quake-2?

<b>Answer:</b><br>
[explanation from Robert]<br>
... use the following Quake-2 console-command, or you might find yourself
spending loads of time making a visually stunning map, only to find out
that it cannot be played for another 5 years until Intel and their competitors
invent a processor that can speed this level up to a playable framerate.

While playing your map in Quake-2, go and stand in the spot that you would like
to "check" and pull down the console with the tilde (~) key. Then type
<tt>timerefresh</tt>
 and hit the enter-key.

The computer will now draw 180 frames
while making a 360 degree pirouette with the "camera" and will measure
the time which it needs to do that in seconds. Dividing 180 through the
number of seconds of course leads to the desired value. The "Frames Per
Second" or shortly "fps". This value should preferably NOT be lower as
24 to 30 (which is considered to be the number of frames that the human
eye can "read" in a second)
<br> ...

[explanation from Decker]<br>
... however the
<tt>timerefresh</tt>
 command, isn't the best way to determine
framerates, since that only gives a value on the spot where its executed.

To get a
more precise fps-value, you must record a demo, running around everywhere in
your level, and then playback the demo with
<tt>timedemo 1</tt>
 enabled.

This will give an
overall fps-value of your entire level, and not just in one spot
<br> ...
