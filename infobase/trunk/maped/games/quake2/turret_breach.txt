title: Turret entities

<b>Question:</b><br>
I am working on a huge turret.

<b>Answer:</b><br>
Turrets are a bit hard to design.

The turret_base and turret_breach must have the same "team" specific.
<br>
The turret_driver's "target" must match the turret_breach's "targetname".
<br>
The turret_breach's "target" must match the "target" of yet another entity, "info_notnull".

You must design and place all three turret_xxx entities as if the turret where looking to the direction 0 (east). If you want
the turret to begin facing another direction, you must set it in the "angle"
specific of both turret_breach and turret_base (not in turret_driver).

Finally, place the "info_notnull" entity at the point from which rockets are
to be thrown. Unlike the other entities, it seems that you must place this one
at the correct position for the turret's starting angle, not for the angle 0.
I mean, you must place it at the place where it WOULD BE if the turret already
rotated to its starting angle.
