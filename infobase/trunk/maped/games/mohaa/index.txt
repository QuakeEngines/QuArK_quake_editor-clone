The Mohaa support is limited, due to the fact that much important information about
entities, such as about their models, is unavailable, and most importantly,
lod terrain is not supported.  I'm not sure when these issues will be resolved,
if ever, but some people seem to find QuArK useful as a prefab &
building-making tool.
