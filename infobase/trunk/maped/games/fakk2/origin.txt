title: Origin collision in game
author: DanielPharos

For some reason, the player can't reach the origin ingame: you keep bumping into it. It's almost asif there is a small collision cube around it. This appears to be a bug in the game (or maybe the compiler). Keep this in mind when making your map! Position your map such that the (0, 0, 0) point is in a (player?)reachable area of your map!
