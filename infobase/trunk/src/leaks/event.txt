title: Unfreed Event (don't mess with)
author: Decker (mostly) & tiglari

The kernel error CreatEvent generated at QkFileObjects.pas:RestoreAutoSaved
line 2061 should not be fixed by deleting the event; here's what Decker had
to say about my attempt to do that:

Oops I believe you just introduced "an unintended bug".

I've looked at that particular piece of code before (less than a month
ago I think), and made up my mind of what it does. Unfortunatly I never
got around to document it. Armin should have done that, when he coded
it. It has something to do, when running two or more instances of QuArK
on the same machine at the same time, and the crashes of QuArK.

Here's my thoughts of it:

- The procedure is called "RestoreAutoSaved", so it might have something
to do with when QuArK crashes and is started again.<br>
- There is a call to "GetCurrentProcessId" at the bottom of the
procedure. So some kind of 'uniqueness' is apparently needed.<br>
- The call to "WaitForSingleObject" has a timeout-value of 0, e.g. don't
wait (quite strange!?).<br>
- The file named "auto-save-<something>", is also referenced in the
procedure "QFileObject.PyGetAttr", where it too use
"GetCurrentProcessId".<br>
- "OldId" gets assigned the value from the file named
"auto-save-<something>".<br>
- So "OldId" may actually be the ProcessId of the QuArK-instance which
created the auto-save file.<br>
- Note that the const "TagAtom" with value "~QuArK-tag-auto-save-%x",
gets its "%x" replaced by "OldId".<br>
- The Delphi documentation for "CreateEvent()" does not directly states
what will be returned, if the name-of-the-event-semaphore already exists
(e.g. another instance of QuArK is already running.) I believe that we
get an invalid handle back in that case.<br>
- The "WaitForSingleObject()" call, destroys "OldId" and assigns it a
completly different purpose; it now contains the return value of the
call. (Bad code style! Better use a variable clearly defined for the
purpose, instead of reusing variables).<br>
- "OldId", which is now the return-value from "WaitForSingleObject()",
gets compared against zero. So can "WaitForSingleObject()" return zero,
and what does zero mean in that case? The Delphi documentation does not
say, so a dig into WINDOWS.PAS searching for the documented return
symbols may tell us what zero means.<br>
- I find that the symbol "WAIT_OBJECT_0" has the constant value of zero,
so statement in "RestoreAutoSaved" would be better written as:<br>
        if (OldId = WAIT_OBJECT_0) then<br>
- Putting some of the stuff together:<br>
  CreateEvent(nil, false, TRUE, <a replaced TagAtom string>);<br>
Note the TRUE, according to the Delphi documentation, this sets the
event-semaphore into a Signaled-State. I then believe, that if
CreateEvent() did not succeed in creating the event-semaphore, the event
is Not Signaled, and therefore WaitForSingleObject() will not return
WAIT_OBJECT_0.<br>
- This could mean that there is another QuArK instance running at the
same time, and therefore the auto-save file is not due to a crashed
QuArK, as it is still running.<br>

- Note also, that any events owned by a process, the one who called
CreateEvent(), gets automatically released/closed by the
operation-system when that process stops/crashes. Thats why Armin never
did nor should do a CloseHandle() on the last CreateEvent(), as it will
destroy the purpose of the WaitForSingleObject() check.

Phew... that was a bit much, for such a little thing ;-)

I know a bit about event/mutex-semaphores, as I use them at work these
days, porting an OS/2-application to Windows 2000 Advanced Server.
