title: Installing Delphi
author: Rowdy

Installing Delphi is a simple matter of running the executable which you downloaded or copied off a magazine cover CD.  Or, if you have obtained a zipped version, unzip it first, and then run the setup program.

Installing the necessary components is covered in the Configuration section, below.

Delphi 6 Personal Edition takes a tad over 100MB to install, Delphi 7 Personal Edition is probably a bit larger.  You should also allow at least 20MB for all the QuArK source (which can be obtained from the SourceForge CVS repository).

If you are lucky enough to have access to a better copy of Delphi (e.g. one of the Professional or Enterprise editions), great!  But you can fully compile QuArK with the Personal Editions.
