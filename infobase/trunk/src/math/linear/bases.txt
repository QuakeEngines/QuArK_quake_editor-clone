title: Axes and Bases

One of the most important aspects of vector spaces (sets
of vectors with their associated math operations such as\
addition) is that they have 'bases', or coordinate systems.
A basis is just three vectors, taken in a definite order,
which don't lie on the same line or plane.  We are usually
interested only in bases where the vectors are of
length 1, and are perpendicular to each other; these
are called 'orthonormal bases' if you want a technical
term for them.

The most familiar (orthonormal) basis is:
<code>
xa = &lt;1, 0, 0>
ya = &lt;0, 1, 0>
za = &lt;0, 0, 1>
</code>
(In vector algebra books these are often called <b>i</b>,
<b>j</b> and <b>k</b>; I'm using xa, ya and za for x-axis,
y-axis and z-axis.)

The most important fact about bases is that any vector can
be expressed as a sum of (scalar) products of the basis
vectors by numbers.  In the case of the standard basis
[xa, ya, za], we have the obvious identity:
<code>
x*xa + y*ya + z*za = &lt;x, y, x>
</code>
However it's also true for arbitrary bases, and even more
usefully, if [xr, yr, zr] is a randomly chosen basis, we
can get the coordinates of any vector v with respect to
that basis by using the dot product:
<code>
v = (xr*v)*xr + (yr*v)*yr + (zr*v)*zr
</code>
(Possibly a bit confusingly, the '*' inside the parentheses
represents the dot product operation two vectors, yielding
a number, while the '*' outside the parentheses represents
the scalar product, multiplying a vector by a number).
