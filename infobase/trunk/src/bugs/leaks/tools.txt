title: Hunting tools
author: DanielPharos

There are many tools out there that can be used to locate and
eliminate memory leaks.  Here's a small list of some of them,
and where to find them:

<strong>WinDBG (Debugging Tools for Windows)</strong><br>
Microsofts official debugging tools.  Might come in handy, but
it can only be used on the actual executable, and thus can
only be applied when searching for leaks the hard way, or for
locating crashes.

<strong>VMMap</strong><br>
Another useful tool is VMMap.  This tool displays all memory
allocations from a process, so memory leaks should be easy
to spot.  It even can search from strings in specific memory
block, so it's possible to identify what exactly is leaking.

<strong>MemProof</strong><br>
A program that monitors the executable realtime, and lists
memory usage.  When the program finishes, all the memory still
being used has obviously leaked.

<strong>MemCheck</strong><br>
Being an alternative memory manager, this replaces the old
MemTester.pas that QuArK uses at the moment.  This has already
been done: all you need to do is to open the .dpr file in the
source directory, comment out MemTester, comment in MemCheck
AND the MemChk below at the end of the file, and you're done.

<strong>FastMM</strong><br>
Another alternative memory manager.  This one is actually so
good, that even Borland (developers of Delphi) started using
this in Delphi 2006!  It has a settings file,
source/prog/FastMM4Options.inc. To enable the Full Debug Mode,
you will need to place a DLL file into your runtime directory.
See the FastMM readme file for more information.

The alternative memory managers have already been installed into QuArK. You can enable them by editing the QuArK.dpr file and switching the comment-tags. You'll find them at the top of the listing of units (a memory manager must be the first unit to load). Note: Only one can be enabled at a time!

Also, don't forget:<br>
There are a lot of debugging options already present in
Delphi (at least in 6 and higher).  Don't forget to check
the Project > Options > Compiler/Compiler Messages/Linker
settings in Delphi.  Also, some of these options have to
be enabled in order to use the full power of the tools
listed above.  Read the respective readme file that comes
with the tool for more information.

Another tool to hunt for problems (especially Python reference
counter bugs) is the plugin called 'devpyobjects.py', which
can output a file containing a list of all the active Python
objects currently in memory. See the file (located in the
'plugins' directory) for more info.
