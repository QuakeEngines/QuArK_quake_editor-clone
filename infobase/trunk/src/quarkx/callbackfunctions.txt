title: Callback functions in Python and Warning about circular references
author: Armin Rigo

At a lot of places, QuArK expects to find a callable Python object. For example, each menu item must have an attribute onclick
that, if not None, will be called by QuArK. The arguments that the function should accept varies from case to case; for
example, the menu item’s onclick is called with a single argument, which is the menu item itself. The call is made by
simulating the Python command apply(onclick, args). This means that onclick doesn’t need to be a function; it can be anything
that is valid to call with the arguments args. In the current Python code, it is often a method instead of a function: if you
give onclick the value someobject.mymethod, that method will be called with one additionnal argument (often called self) before
the normal ones given by QuArK: the object someobject itself.

This is pretty useful in all cases where the arguments given by QuArK are not enough to really know what occured. Typically,
onclick will point to a method of the MapEditor object, so that we immediately know in which MapEditor instance we are.
However, be careful about circular references: this technique makes a reference from the menu item’s onclick member to the
given MapEditor instance, which in turn is likely to somehow reference the menu item through a pointer to the whole menu. In
this kind of situation, neither the MapEditor instance nor the menu item will ever be freed from memory. This situation is
allowed if you take care of breaking them: that’s why, when the MapEditor window is closed, a lot of its attributes are reset
to None. This would free the menu, which in turn would let the MapEditor be freed.
