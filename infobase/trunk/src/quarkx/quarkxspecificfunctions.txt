title: QuArK-specific functions of the module quarkx
author: Armin Rigo

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>

<tr><td class="doccode">
Setup1(...)
</td><td>
Must be called at start-up for initialization only. See <tt>quark.py</tt>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
action()
</td><td>
Starts an undoable user action. Returns a copy of the <tt>undo</tt> module described below.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
getchangednames()
</td><td>
Returns a list with, one or more, tuple lists <tt>(oldname, newname)</tt> inside it, each consisting of two string items that give the old and new names of an object that was renamed.
Do not call this function directly or it will clear the list, call it using a variable to be set by it.<br>
For example: <g>changednames = quarkx.getchangednames()</g><br>
Then use the variable to work with. If nothing has been renamed then this function will only return <tt>None</tt>, but not as a string item.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
undostate(obj)
</td><td>
Returns a tuple <tt>(undostr, redostr)</tt> with two strings that give the next operation that can be undone (resp. redone) on the object <tt>obj</tt>. <tt>undostr</tt> and <tt>redostr</tt> are set to <tt>None</tt> if there is no operation to undo (resp. redo).
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
boundingboxof(list)
</td><td>
Returns a bounding box <tt>(vmin, vmax)</tt> for the given <tt>list</tt> of map objects, or <tt>None</tt>. <tt>vmin</tt> and <tt>vmax</tt> are 3D vector objects. The list may also contain (non-projected) 3D vector objects that will be included in the returned bounding box.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
texturesof(list)
</td><td>
Returns a sorted list of all texture names used in the given <tt>list</tt> of map objects.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
extendcoplanar(list, lookin)<br>
extendcoplanar(list, lookin, side)
</td><td>
<tt>list</tt> should be a list of polyhedron faces. This routine searches for faces in the objects in the list <tt>lookin</tt> that are coplanar and adjacent to the given faces, and appends them to <tt>list</tt>. All given faces must already be coplanar. <tt>side</tt> controls whether two faces of opposite normal vector match; <tt>1</tt> must be the same direction, <tt>-1</tt> must be opposite, <tt>0 </tt>(default) both. Note that the resulting <tt>list</tt> may contain a face more than once if it is shared by several polyhedron or if it was originally both in <tt>list</tt> and <tt>lookin</tt>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
forms()<br>
forms(1)<br>
forms(2)
</td><td>
Returns a list of all opened windows. Note that this is currently not very useful, because only Python-controlled windows are included. In the second form of the call, Floating windows are included as well. In the 3rd form of the call, non-Python windows are included as <tt>None</tt> in the list, and the order is such as the first item in the list represents the active window.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
newform()
</td><td>
Opens a new window. Don’t use this. To create floating toolbox windows, see <tt>newfloating()</tt>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
update()<br>
update(form)
</td><td>
Updates the window <tt>form</tt>, or all windows if not specified. Menu bars, toolbars, and buttons are updated. See below for more information.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
opentoolbox(toolbox)<br>
opentoolbox(toolbox, select)
</td><td>
Opens the toolbox given by name. If <tt>toolbox</tt> is empty ex: <tt>quarkx.opentoolbox("")</tt>, this function opens the texture browser. If <tt>select</tt> is the actual texture object (see quarkpy\mdlbtns.py texturebrowser function for code example), attempts to find and select this Internal object in the toolbox. If <tt>select</tt> is <tt>None</tt>, and if some objects were previously selected in the toolbox, they are unselected.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
findtoolboxes()<br>
findtoolboxes(tb)
</td><td>
Find all toolbox data objects. Returns a list of couples <tt>("toolbox name", rootofdata)</tt>. If <tt>tb</tt> is specified, it must be a string and <tt>findtoolboxes</tt> will only return data for this toolbox.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
openconfigdlg()<br>
openconfigdlg(path)<br>
openconfigdlg(caption, obj, newobjlist)
</td><td>
Opens the Configuration dialog box. If <tt>path</tt> is given, the corresponding folder or subfolder is opened, e.g. "<tt>Map:Options</tt>", or "<tt>:</tt>" for the current game’s configuration page. In the third form, <tt>obj</tt> is a <tt>:config</tt> object that gives alternate configuration data to display, and <tt>caption</tt> is the window caption. In this case, the dialog box is modal and <tt>openconfigdlg</tt> returns <tt>1</tt> or <tt>0</tt> to let you know if the user clicked on Ok or Cancel. <tt>newobjlist</tt> is a list of objects that the user can insert from buttons, or <tt>None</tt> if no editing of the object hierarchy is allowed.
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="doccode">
globalaccept()<br>
globalaccept(ok)
</td><td>
Ends pending user editing (e.g. in yellow edit boxes). If <tt>ok</tt> is <tt>True</tt> or omitted, the changes are accepted; otherwise, they are cancelled.
</td></tr>
