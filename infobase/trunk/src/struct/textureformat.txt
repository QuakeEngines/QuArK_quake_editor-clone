title: Texture format
author: DanielPharos

Image data, or textures, are stored in specifics of objects,
or Pixel Set Descriptors (PSD) QuArK's internal image format.

There are three specifics:

<g>Image#</g>  (Where # is a number)<br>
<g>Pal</g><br>
<g>Alpha</g><br>

Usually, there's only one image per texture, so there is only an <g>Image1</g>.
If the texture doesn't contain any alpha-color data, <g>Alpha</g> doesn't exist.
If the picture isn't a paletted image, like a pcx file, <g>Pal</g> doesn't exist.

There are two different formats that QuArK uses internally,
and every loaded image is converted to those formats on load:
<ul>
<li>24-bit non-paletted, and
<li>8-bit paletted with a 24-bit palette.
</ul>

The Image-specific is stored in a way Windows can understand directly.
The details of it might seem a bit weird, but this is the way Windows works
(this gave Windows extra speed back in the old 486-days).
All the data in the Image-specific must be aligned on a 32-bit boundary per scanline.
What does this mean?

A scanline is simply a row of pixels as displayed on the screen.
These are <g>picture-width</g> pixels in a single row.
However, the amount of bytes used per row must be a multiple of 4 (32 bits = 4 bytes of 8 bits each).
So there is a <g>padding</g> amount of <g>empty</g>, unused, erroneous bytes at the end of each row.
You can set them to any value, since they won't be displayed, but making them zero's is probably nicest.
How to calculate the amount of padding bytes, you ask?<br>
The amount of bits used in a single row of pixels is:
<g>picture-width</g> x <g>bits per pixel</g>.

The reason for the 8 bits each is because RGB images have a <g>Decimal</g> numbering for each Red, Green,
Blue channel, or color component, that ranges from 0 to 255, or 256 digits, where pure white would be
255, 255, 255. Alpha would also be an additional component which we are skipping over for right now.

But the point is, you can see how cumbersome that would be to store, as well as take more bits in memory.
So to overcome this they use what is known as the <g>Hex</g> or <g>Hexadecimal</g> numbering system instead.
This system has a total of 16 digits, 0 through 9 plus A, B, C, D, E AND F. Each pixel is an RGBA,
Red, Green, Blue and Alpha (which may not be used) component. Each of those components gets 2 bits for their <g>Hex</g>
number looking something like this, FFFFFF, which again is pure white, with Alpha being overlooked for now.
If an image does have an Alpha component then its <g>Hex</g> number would look like this FFFFFFFF,<br>
<g>2 bits per component x 4 RGBA components = 8 bits each per pixel</g>.<br>
Pretty slick how that all works, isn't it?
A good example is to look at this <a href="colorconverter/rgb.htm">Color Converter</a>.

Bits per pixel is usually a number like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 or 32.
This now gives the amount of bits per line. We need to round this up to the closest multiple of 32 bits.
The simplest way is by adding an additional 31, then dividing by 32 and rounding down the result.
This will give the amount of bytes per scanline.

To find the amount of padding bytes, simply subtract the amount of bytes used in a single row of pixels:<br>
<g>padding</g> = <g>picture-width</g> x <g>bits per pixel</g> - <g>amount-of-bits-per-scanline</g>

But be careful: the scanlines are stored upside-down.
This means that the first bytes you read in, are actually the first pixels of the LAST line to display!<br>
(The picture is stored vertically mirrored, or flipped!)
Just do a simple <g>picture-height</g> - <g>line-I-want</g> to get the correct number of the scanline.
Since you know the amount of bytes per scanline (nicely aligned, so no half-byte locations here!),
you can find the start of the scanline by a simple multiplication.

Since QuArK uses only 8 bits or 24 bits internally, there are only two possibilities.
Check for the existence of the <g>Pal</g>-specific: if it's there, you're looking at an 8-bit texture,
if not, then it must be a 24-bit texture.

If <g>Pal</g> does exists, then this is a list of 256, 24 bit colors, stored in a 32-bit format:
RGB (Red, Green, Blue, no Alpha here). So each color is 4 bytes in size.
Color 0 is the first color in the list, etc.

<g>Alpha</g> contains any Alpha data there might be.
This is just a list of alpha-color values, no padding involved.
