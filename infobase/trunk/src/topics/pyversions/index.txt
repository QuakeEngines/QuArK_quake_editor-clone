title: Python Interpreters & Versions
author: tiglari, Peter Brett, DanielPharos

Python support and versioning is implemented in
'source/python/Python.pas' and 'source/python/PyVersions.inc'.

QuArK first looks for the 'dlls/Python.dll', and if that is not
found, it looks for the appropriate DLL using the default Windows
search behaviour.  The following versions are supported with the
appropriate defines set.
<ul>
<li>Python 2.6: 'PYTHON26' (python26.dll) (at the time of writing, only alpha versions have been released, so this version is not supported).</li>
<li>Python 2.5: 'PYTHON25' (python25.dll) (not officially supported).</li>
<li>Python 2.4: 'PYTHON24' (python24.dll) - this is the default.</li>
<li>Python 2.3: 'PYTHON23' (python23.dll)</li>
<li>Python 2.2: 'PYTHON22' (python22.dll)</li>
<li>Python 2.1: 'PYTHON21' (python21.dll)</li>
<li>Python 2.0: 'PYTHON20' (python20.dll)</li>
<li>Python 1.x: Not supported anymore</li>
</ul>

Note that if you downloaded a source distribution of QuArK, the
appropriate 'python.dll' should be included in the archive.

The bundled Python support is to get around the fact that the version
of Python supported can only be set at compile time.  It substantially
simplifies the installation process for the end user, and makes only
one download necessary.  It also ensures that all end users are
running the same version of Python, removing a possible source of bugs
(people using the wrong version of Python for the QuArK binary they
have).  It also allows us to go ahead with writing code that requires
features only available in more recent versions of Python.
