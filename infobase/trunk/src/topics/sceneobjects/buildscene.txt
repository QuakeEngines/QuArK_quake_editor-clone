  If a 3d window is open, gets called every time anything happens to the
   views.  This seems excessive, for example for a selection event very little
   gets changed.

  1.  some initializations:
         Held over from previous BuildScene:
           TextureManager
         Reinitialized:
           TexNames list
           FlistSurfaces - done via linked list freeing, maybe a slowdown factor?
           nVertexList and nVertexList2

  2.  scan the map objects and build the TexNames list, which gives
        information about surfaces indexed by the TexNames, and
        also add this information to the FlistSurfaces list.
        
      Problem: the info specifyies how much info is needed to store
      the vertexes of the faces using the texture, but no info about
      those vertexes seems to be recorded.


  3.  rebuild the old textures, note how many new ones needed.
        Q: what does building do?

  4.  free old textures no longer needed

  5.  load and build new textures

  6.  build a lot of stuff

  7.  for each face, load a lot of stuff into the appropriate
        surf3d element [some of it looks like texture coordinates]

  8.  ditto for models, sprites and beziers
        lots of rather repetitive-looking code.

  9.  and a bit of final cleanup.

More understanding of what goes on in steps 6-8 is needed here.
