title: QuArK 6.2 (superceded)
author: tiglari

Stuff actually implemented in QuArK 6.2.  Perhaps
somebody could produce accurate lists for 6.0
and 6.1?

<ul>

<li>Q3(T)A Model display: (Andy/Maleficus)
<br> Complex models now showing

<li>OsFolders: (tiglari)
<br> Load up resources from disk by specified paths etc.
Editing of folder properties not implemented.

<li>Bezier Page: (tiglari)
<br>No 'cp picking' or linear mapping handles.

<li>Bezier CP Picking: (tiglari)
<br>Select certain cp's & operate on them only. (in map views, not
bezier page)

<li>Read/Write Brush Primitives: (tiglari)
<br>There's a potential for imprecisions to accumulate if
stuff is imported & exported multiple times/

<br>So Quark is now among other things a WC3.3<->standard format
map converter.

<br>Only for the buttons, don't yet understand how
to do it for direct insert from toolbox menu.

<li>Path duplicator: (Decker, tiglari)
<br>With tiling substructures, 'elbow spaces', point position/creation
dialogs, `roll control'.

<li>Patch-based shape builders: (tiglari)

<br>STVEF (Alex, Jeff[EFR]Scorpion, Mark Matthieson, tiglari)
<br>Q3TA (Maleficus, Andy)

needs more work from somebody knowledgeable about CS.

<li>Model editor: (Andy)
<br>pre-alpha Q1/2

<br>moves & points the camera in an open
3d view to look head on at the face (ctrl to view from backside)

<br>Makes copies of things
radially around a tiltable axis, with 'spiral' attributes.
