title: Tags & Branches
author: tiglari, etc.

The idea here is to record tags and branches entered into the
repository, with comments on their purpose and status.  I've
only done a few recent ones, mostly that I've been responsible for.

<UL>
<LI> <B>REL_61</B>: the branch for the Quark 6.1 release.
<LI> <B>rel-63</B>: a short-lived branch for putting new stuff
  that wasn't supposed to go into 62. relevant contents merged
  into the main branch.
<LI> <B>rel-63-exp</B>: ditto.
<LI> <B>REL_62</B>: branch for the 6.2 release.  Hopefully closed off now!
<LI> <B>pre-635c1</B>: a tag before adding a bunch of stuff just prior
  to the intended rc1 (frozen selection, bilinear filtering in OBL).
<LI> <B>rel-63a</b>: the 6.3 release branch, 'a' because of the ill-fated
  63 branch above.
<LI> <B>rel-6-3-0</b>: the tag for the actual release on the rel-63a branch.
<LI> <B>DanielPharos</B>: the branch where DanielPharos did his OpenGL work.
  <br><I>obsolete</I>
<LI> <B>Leakhunt 1, 2</B> for runtime: useless bungling.
<LI> <B>Leakhunt 3</B> for runtime: leak hunting modifications.
<LI> <B>Leakhunt 3</B> for source: more bungling, needed
  stuff in main branch.
<LI> <B>MidJuneSnap</B>: ?
<LI> <B>ModelEditorRebuild</B>: Attempt to restructure the model editor.
  <br><I>obsolete</I>
<LI> <B>ModelEditorBoneRebuild</B>: Attempt to restructure the way the model
  editor handled bones.
  <br><I>obsolete</I>
<LI> <B>NewGameSupport660b3</B>: Branch where some experimental new game
  support work is done.
<LI> <B>NuTex</B>: an experimental branch for testing schemes
  for dissociating texture positioning from face-positioning.
  <br><I>obsolete</I>
<LI> <B>NuTex2</B>: an newer experimental branch for testing schemes
  for dissociating texture positioning from face-positioning.
  <br>only applies to QkMapPoly.pas
<LI> <B>peter-b_tagging_api</B>: ?
<LI> <B>Q3ABSPM</B>: only for QkBsp.pas, QkBspHull.pas: Q3A Bsp
  reading.  Now s/b closed, its stuff is on the main branch.
</UL>
