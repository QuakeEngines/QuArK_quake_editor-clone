title: Big Ideas
author: tiglari, etc.

Ambitious, not necessarily realistic proposals, ranging
from the relatively straightforward to crazed dreams.  More likely
as Quarkplusplus features.

<ul>

<li> Auto-binary qrk:
<br>When a text-based .qrk is loaded, write a binary format equivalent
with extenion .brk; then next time load that unless the .qrk is newer
(same logic as .py and .pyc).

<li>Model editor: (Andy, tiglari)
<br>export closed mesh to brushset

<li> NetQuark: (???)
Multi-user editing over the net.  Would need somebody who
really knows what they're doing.  Probably not a
realistic target.  Support for collaboration via CVS might be
more plausible.  Unlikely to be build, would need a entire
rebuild of the code.  Maybe an idea for Quarkplusplus?

<li>persistent edits: (?)
<br>undo/redo info written to files/saved with maps,
supporting playable entity demos (Ax2grind idea),
and 'orthogonal persistence' (http://www.tunes.org)
of editing sessions

<li>XML support: (?)
<br>Maximum possible compatibility with GtkRadiant Xmap, which doesn't
seem to be going anywhere at the moment.

<li>Qrk editor: (?)
<br>Edit .qrk's in the style of a decent XML editor
<br>Andy's form-editing extension to the explorer are basically
implementing this.

<li>Integrated Dynamic bsp builder: (?)
<br>bsp building & optimization while u're scratching
ur head...

<li>Surf Inspectors: (?)
<br>Laid out more like in Radiant, which I like
better than Quark's long list.

<li>More Game Formats: (?)
<br>Unreal engine, Serious Sam, Far Cry...
<!-- Heroes of Might and Magic (Quark was
used some internally for either the one coming out now or the one
before it, so maybe this one has a chance). 
DanielPharos: First of all, I think it's Might and Magic, no Heroes
of Might and Magic. Second, I can't find anything proving this...-->
</ul>
