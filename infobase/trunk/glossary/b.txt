<dt><a name="boundingbox">              </a>Bounding Box                <dd>[B-Box] A rectangular 3D area, which can be represented by two vectors; (minimum X, minimum Y, minimum Z) - (maximum X, maximum Y, maximum Z). A bounding box is the smallest box possible that still encompasses everything it's a bounding box of.

<dt><a name="brushsubtraction">         </a>Brush Subtraction           <dd>An action to remove parts from a brush, where another brush intersects. It is also know as <a href="#brushcarving">brush carving</a>.

<dt><a name="binaryspacepartitions">    </a>Binary Space Partitions     <dd>[BSP] A mathematical method of storing 3D objects in a 'space', so when viewing from some point in 'space', only visible objects are drawn to the viewer, instead of drawing <u>everything</u>, even objects that are behind or hidden from the viewers point of view.

<dt><a name="buildtools">               </a>Build tools                 <dd>Programs that are needed to create (<a href="#compile">compile</a>) a file which will contain the final map. They are commonly known as; QBSP.EXE, QBSP3.EXE, VIS.EXE, QVIS3.EXE, LIGHT.EXE, QRAD3.EXE and QCSG.EXE, but that all depends on the <a href="#fps">FPS-game</a>. There are basically three steps in the build process, after the map-editor has created a <a href="#.MAP">.MAP</a> file;<br>
                                                                            1) convert a .MAP file to a <a href="#.BSP">.BSP</a> without vis/light information,<br>
                                                                            2) vis (visibility) the produced .BSP file, to optimize in-game drawing,<br>
                                                                            3) light the .BSP file, so it won't appear completely dark or fullbright.
