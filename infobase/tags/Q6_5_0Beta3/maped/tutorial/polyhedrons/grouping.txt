Now your tree-view might look something like as in this image:

Imagine what would happen, when you have 400+ brushes like that. How on earth
are you going to know what brush are related to what?

This is where <g>groups</g> are used. You can group together, those brushes and
entities which, e.g. belongs to a single room, an advanced multi-segmented
door, a vehicle which consists of many brushes, etc.

To group brushes and entities, you first <ref> ../starting/deleting \ select </ref>
the ones which should be grouped together. Then you press the
<ref> intro/mapeditor/misctools/newgroup \ new group </ref> icon

Try to group your 6 brushes, which is your room. The tree-view should show you
something similar as shown in this image:

You can of cause give the group a more meaningful name, by selecting the
group-object, and press the F2 key, or slowly double-clicking on it. (Just like
in Windows' File-Explorer.)

I suggest you rename your newly created group to: <tt>My first room</tt>.

There are some special things you can do with groups, but that is explained in
the <ref> ../advanced/grouptechniques </ref>. However, if you are curious, just
right-click on the group-object, to get its context-menu up.
