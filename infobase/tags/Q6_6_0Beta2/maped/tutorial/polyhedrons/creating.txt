I presume you have deleted the default room completely, because we need a blank
sheet in this section.

A <g>brush</g> is like a brick. You use them to build floors, walls and
ceilings with.
Even the sky and water are build with brushes. The word <tt>brush</tt> is not
really a good word, but it has become commonly known as; "the object with which
to build levels with, for a <g>Quake-engine</g> game". QuArK also uses the word
<g>polyhedron</g> or the shorter <g>poly</g>, to indicate a brush. You may even
see the word <g>cube</g>, but it is still a brush/polyhedron.

So to create a brush, click on the icon shown in the image. This will create a
cube with a <ref> intro/configuration/map/building \ default size</ref> and
<ref> intro/configuration/games \ default texture </ref> in your map.

Your new brush will be shown as selected in the 2D-views, by showing it in
<ref> intro/configuration/map/colors \ a shade of blue </ref> and with movement
handles.
