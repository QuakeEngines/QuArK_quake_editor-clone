title: QuArK 6.3 (stable)
author: tiglari, etc.

QuArK 6.3.0 has been released; there is also an update patch, and there
will very likely be a 6.3.1 with some minor bugfixes and improvements.
Probabl that will be that.

First, what what has been implemented in QuArK 6.3.0, at least as much of it
as we remembered to record!  The now uninformative 'status' info (e.g.
'done') has been removed, but some of the more contentful ones have been
left.  Feel free to add additional features to this list that QuArK actually
acquired but got left out.

<ul>
<li>6DX Engine Support: (decker, Jacob Marner)

<li>Crystal Space Support: (tiglari, funkiedamouse)

<li>Linear Matrix editor: (tiglari, lots of design from Rolf Hulsbergen)
<br>crank out matrices for rotation, scaling
etc. from intelligible parameters (from pushbutton in duplicator
forms).

<li>Extruder: (tiglari)
<br>generate brushes etc. from 2d outlines.
<br>status: done (integrates with path duplicator); some extensions
currently being added.

<li>'New Copy One' duplicator: (tiglari)
<br> put copies of a structure where you want it.  Inspired
by a suggestion by Meatball402 on Quake3World editing forum.

<li>User-configurable hot keys: (tiglari)
<br>What additional ones should be added?

<li>User-specifible rotation/linear mapping origin: (tiglari)
<br>Do they really need to be persistent properties of groups?
(as opposed say to a tagged point)
<br>what about axis? No, wouldn't integrate with the buttons.
<br>status: redone as handle (old origin duplicator removed
from interface).  Works as fixpoint for scale/rotate linear specifics
in some duplicators.

<li>Merge Polys: (tiglari)
<br>bugs fixed, merge all mergeable polys in group

<li>Form-editing: (Andy)
<br> Includes create capacity.

<li> Entity Extractor: (Andy)
<br> Entities extracted from .bsp's in many formats
(including Q3(T)A).  Runs out of memory on some maps in some .pk3's.
This can be worked around by extracting the .bsps to individual
files.

<li>Selection modes: (tiglari)
<br>Configuragle 'Aux Keys', by default 'F' for face, 'B' for brush,
'C' for curve, 'E' for entity (point or brush).  'P' and 'F' don't have
drilldown, this is a bit asymmetrical but I don't think it really matters.

<li>L-square enhancements: (tiglari, ax2grind)
<br>status: started, align & glue to tagged done.  I intend
to leave further enhancements as an exercise for someone who
wants to learn more about QuArK-Python programming.

<LI>Tree navigation: (tiglari, design from Decker, realdespair)
<br> home, pg up, pg down for parent, next prev in group, cycling.
Plus some kind of option for getting next-of-same-type in group.
<br>status: basic stuff done.  Perhaps add more refined same-type
option (=classname for point entities, brush entities, =macro
for duplicators)

<li> Entity Lump Extractor: (tiglari)
<br> extracts entity lumps from .bsp's in a .pak to independent files.
<br> status: done but seems to fail with STVEF .bsp's whose names
begin with underscore.  More thought about easy preparation of
entity addons is needed.

<li>3point cutting plane: (tiglari)

<li>Pythonify entity def converters: (Andy)

<li>texture search facility: (Andy, suggestions from quantum_red)

<li>storable camera positions: (tiglari, design from quantum_red)

<li>group selection movement commands: (tiglari, design from Alan Donald and quantum_red)
<br>exchange position & align (WC-style)

<li>incrementable specifics in duplicators: (subnoodle, tiglari)
<br>status: done except for radial duplicator.

<li>texture-replacement specifics for duplicators: (tiglari)
<br>status: done except for radial.

<li>promotion/demotion of submenus: (tiglari)
<br>status: done for texture & tagging (not intended
for all submenus, just some of the more useful ones)

<li>Code specifics for toolbar buttons: (Andy)

<li>Support for Gunman, Blue Shift & other HL derivatives: (Decker)

<li>Arg Replacer: (decker)

<li>Show/edit entities for supported games bsp's: (tiglari)
<br>status: done except for Sin (a fourth bsp structure
probably over-strains the present code structure).

<li>Inspect nodes & planes in bsps: (tiglari)

<li>Object snapper: (tiglari, idea from quantum red)
<br> align/move object w.r.t. face so that face and
a face of the object are paralell.

<li>Object slider enhancement: (tiglari)
<br>Now moves object over plane and along normal.

<li> Don't draw restricted out stuff: (tiglari)
<br>when hide-out-of-view is checkd.

<li> Search for defective textures: (tiglari)
<br>whose scales are too small (request from rust QuArK forum)

<li>'Move containing' item on the vertex RMB: (tiglari)
<br>that moves the parent item selected from the submenu so that
the vertex becomes on-grid (solution to problem from the RQF)

<li>'Output Map Format' field in game configs: (tiglari)
<br>replacing some of the Map Options.

<li>various selection modes: (tiglari)
<br>frozen selections (shift RMB) that don't change until another
frozen selection is made, selection of brush, face, patch, entity only,
done via 'auxiliary keys' (hold down during mouseclick).  Frozen
selections appear to be at least a partial implementation of a suggestion
by rd.

<li>bilinear filtering option in texture views: (tiglari)
<br>prodding from aguir_re.

<li>Support RTCW, JKII, Torque, partial support for Mohaa.

<li>bilinear filtering option added to OGL view: (tiglari)
<br>prodding from aguir_re, facilitated by a nice intro OGL
tutorial from which some code could be cribbed, also I suspect
some previous cleanup by Decker.

<li>Fixed problem with 2-monitor usage of QuArK:
<br>breakthru insights from quantum_red and Decker.

<li>Radiant-style dragging, with frozen selections: (tiglari)
<br>The justification for this is that I think it might be fast
and convenient in certain cirucmstances. (Also a 'how it was done'
story might be a good QuArK-Python tutorial on handling mouse stuff.)
<br>status: <strong>done</strong>

<li>Basic SoF2 support: (tiglari, CHK Shoot)

<li>jump-pad trajectory calculator: (decker)

<li>non-integral face finder-fixer: (tiglari)

<li>liner mappings work on path duplicator: (tiglari)
</ul>

And in future updates + 6.3.1.
<UL>
<LI> enhanced wallmaker: (tiglari)
<br>status: done in current update patch
<LI> target finder: (tiglari)
<br> status: done in current update patch
<LI> enhanced prism builder: (ax2grind, cdunde)
<br>status: done in current update patch
<LI> tagging commands toolbar: (cdunde)
<status>done as plugin
<LI> more flexible vertex movement: (milifaar)
<status>done as plugin
</ul>
