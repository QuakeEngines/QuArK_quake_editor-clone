This page is used for a variety of different elements that have a set of
parameters to set, so they act in a certain way. These parameters are called
<i>specifics</i> in QuArK. Each specific can have an argument (arg) attached to it.
At this time primarily <a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#bones">Bones</a>
and <a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html">Python Model Importers\Exporters</a> use it.
Selecting the <g>Frames</g> folder or a number of frames only will display the
<g>model type page</g>, while selecting a single frame will display settings for that
type of model, is any exist, and\or a single bone will display the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#bones">bone's page</a>.
Selecting a single component displays its page where you can set a <g>tint</g> color for each
component that will be applied over that component's texture and lines when a
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">view's RMB menu</a> item
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">Use Component Colors</a>
is active (checked) to help distinguish one component from another.

If you do not know what permitted values an arg can have, place your
mouse-cursor over that item for a second and a blue 'flyover' help-box will appear,
if there is any help for that specific/arg pair.

Sometimes there may be a dropdown-listbox which contain valid args, or most
used args. Some specifics are only possible to turn on/off, these looks like
checkboxes. There might even be pushbuttons which opens another window, with
more specific/arg settings.

The above icons from left to right:

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i>SF<br>set model type</i>
  </td>
  <td>
    Click on this icon to display supported Python Import\Exporters
    and select one you wish to use for exporting your model as and\or
    specifics of that type of model format, any of which can use this page.<br>
    See the section about <ref>intro/modeleditor/importexport</ref>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign=top align=center>
    <i>HelpBook</i>
  </td>
  <td>
    Keep your mouse-cursor steady on this icon to get a blue 'flyover'
    help-box, which will contain specific description/help for the selected
    item, and not just a single specific/arg pair. Press the icon to display
    this help in a window. Some elements that use this page may provide additional
    detail, pressing your <b>F1</b> key will take you to a page which contains more
    information about its use, if there is such a page.
