title: The Model's Mesh(s)
author: cdunde

A model is constructed from a mesh, which is a list of triangles grouped together to create its shape.
The model can be a single mesh or it can consist of a number of meshes. In QuArK we call these meshes <g>components</g>.
And therefore, each <g>component</g> of a model has its own group of triangles which are known as a components
<a href="src.quarkx.html#objectsmodeleditor">Tris Specific</a> as stated in the
<a href="src.quarkx.html#objectsmodeleditor">Quarkx Model Editor section</a> of these Infobase docs.
<g>Tris</g> is an abbreviation for triangles.

Even though you can think of a component's Tris as a very complex poly, like those used in the QuArK Map Editor,
and each triangle as a face of that poly, these triangles are handled differently in the Model Editor.
However, like a poly face, each triangle has three <g>vertexes</g> arranged in a specific order which tells which side of that triangle face is facing outwards.

Instead of a set of 3 <g>tuples</g> of 3 values each (x, y and z) that give the 3 points of a triangle,
the triangle of a component gives these values for its 3 <g>tuples</g>:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>1st item:</i> The triangle’s <g>vertexnumber</g>, also known as its <g>index number</g>, which can be used to call a specific triangle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>2nd item:</i> The <g>skin_s</g> value for the horizontal position location of the models triangle on its skin texture image.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>3rd item:</i> The <g>skin_t</g> value for the vertical position location of the models triangle on its skin texture image.

This can be misleading if you do not understand the differences between the 3 <g>tuples</g> of a
standard poly triangle and the triangle of a models component mesh or Tris. This is also discribed in the
<a href="src.quarkx.html#objectsmodeleditor">Quarkx Model Editor section</a> of these Infobase docs.

The actual 3 point positions of a components triangle are given by calling the triangle's <g>vertexnumber</g>
to retrieve its <g>vertices</g> list which is a set of 3 <g>tuples</g> of 3 values each (x, y and z)
that give the 3 points for that triangle. Again, this is briefly covered in the
<a href="src.quarkx.html#objectsmodeleditor">Quarkx Model Editor section</a> of these Infobase docs.

I realize all of this can be confusing, so let me give you an example using some actual code that is
located in two related sections of the <g>quarkpy\mdlhandles.py</g> file that create and draw the handle for each vertex.


In this first section of code we start off by setting up a list that will be used to store all of the handles (line 1), as they are created and drawn.<br>
Next we can see how the <g>component.triangles</g> is called to retrieve its Tris list and their <g>tuple</g> values (line 2).<br>
Now we can call for the <g>vertices</g> of each triangle, in a loop function, by its index <g>vertexnumber</g> (lines 3 and 4).<br>
Once we get one vertices of a triangle, we then go into another loop to retrieve each of the 3 vertex point values (x, y and z)<br>
for one of the 3 points of that triangel (lines 5 and 6).<br>
We then do two things as one, pass the data to the second section of code, which is covered further down,<br>
and <g>append</g> (add) the returned handle to our <g>h</g> handle list (line 7). Which in this case is for the Skin-view handles.

<g>(line 1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h = [ ]</g><br>
<g>(line 2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tris = component.triangles</g><br>
<g>(line 3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for i in range(len(tris)):</g><br>
<g>(line 4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tri = tris[i]</g><br>
<g>(line 5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for j in range(len(tri)):</g><br>
<g>(line 6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vtx = tri[j]</g><br>
<g>(line 7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h.append(SkinHandle(quarkx.vect(vtx[1]-int(texWidth*.5), vtx[2]-int(texHeight*.5), 0), i, j, component, texWidth, texHeight, tri))</g>

A print statement you can use to print it to the QuArK console is this:
<code>print "SkinHandle ",quarkx.vect(vtx[1], vtx[2], 0), i, j</code>
placed just under the code line above. The console will display  3 vertexes for each face like this:

SkinHandle &nbsp;&nbsp;40 46 0 74 0<br>
SkinHandle &nbsp;&nbsp;59 48 0 74 1<br>
SkinHandle &nbsp;&nbsp;55 34 0 74 2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2D pix. pos.&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y&nbsp;&nbsp;z&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;face index number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vertex order in a clockwise direction

One final thing you might want to notice is the very last item, or argument, that we pass to the <g>class SkinHandle</g> code section is <g>the list of triangle vertices</g> or <g>tri</g> itself.<br>
This we will use in that code to do one other function, that of drawing the <g>movement</g> lines of a vertex handle, as a guide, while it is being dragged to change the position of the vertex and skin appearance on the model.

Now for the <g>class SkinHandle</g> part of the code, located above this code, in the same <g>quarkpy\mdlhandles.py</g> file, but I won't go through all of it here, for simplicity.

The <g>class SkinHandle</g> section consist of two main parts, the <g>def draw</g> and the <g>def drag</g> sections, the first of the two being simpler and more direct to the point I am making to the code. So we will take
a look at the <g>def draw</g> section in part. One basic point about classes here is that we do not pass all of the above <g>arguments</g> directly to the <g>def drag</g> section itself, but to the class that it lies within.
From the base class we can then pass it on to the actual <g>def draw</g> section by attaching the word <g>self</g>, meaning the class itself, and because the <g>def draw</g> is within that class we can then use <g>self.triangle</g>
and use that arguments data in the draw section. Note how we also changed the arguments variable name from just <g>tri</g> to <g>triangle</g> to make it more clear in the code as to what that item really represents (or actually contains).

Now , in the <g>def draw</g> section of code, we will just look at a few lines intermittently to see how it uses this particular argument.

First we obtain it from the base class arguments that it receives and redefine it with a new name (line 1).<br>
Next, because it already is <g>the list of triangle vertices</g> that we need, we simply use a loop to go through that list, one vertex at a time, and get the data for each vertex of the triangle that we need to draw the vertex dragging guide lines (line 2).<br>

This next part is a little bit tricky to understand, so bear with me.<br>
In the <g>def draw</g> section, it receives an argument <g>self</g> also, which in the <g>def draw</g> case, <b>IS</b> the vertex handle that we are dragging, and also position 0 of the triangle.<br>
It is also located in <g>the list of triangle vertices</g> along with the triangles two other vertex positions, 1 and 2. Items like this start with a count of 0 instead of 1 when it comes to programming. So the two other vertexes represent the <g>stationary</g>
vertexes of the triangle that are <b>NOT</b> being dragged, but are needed to draw the lines from the one that is being dragged, and to give us our guide line fixed positions for drawing in a lime green color so they are easily seen in the Skin-view as shown in the screen shot.

So with that out of the way, we pull those stationary vertexes out of the list, which is a <g>tuple</g> of 3 vertexes (pos 0, 1 and 2), and define each vertex as a <g>vector</g> called <g>fixedvertex</g> (line 10), skipping the first one (lines 3-6) because that is our <g>self</g> drag handle.
Which we already have and will be drawing our guide lines from.

Something else you might have noticed here is that we <b>do not</b> use position 0 and 1 (x and y) here as you might think, but positions 1 and 2 (y and z) instead.<br>
<g>vertex[1]...vertex[2]</g><br>
Don't ask me why, it's just the way the <g>quarkx.vect</g> function works.

Once we have defined our <g>vector</g> it also becomes a <g>tuple</g>, so now we need to pull out that vertex's positions for X , Y and Z (line 11).<br>
Because these positions are actually pixels on a flat 2D screen (your monitor), with 0,0 being at the upper left hand corner of the Skin-view, the value for Z is not needed.<br>
So we just ignore that one and use the X and Y positions for the fixed end of a line and the X and Y positions of our vertex handle for the other end( line 12).

Remember, this is done for each line that is drawn as the handle vertex and its triangle are passed to the <g>class  SkinHandle</g> from the first section of code.
Looking at the actual and complete code in the file will fill in the gaps and help answer any questions of other items shown below.

<g>(line 1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;triangle = self.triangle</g>

(skipping a few lines of code)

<g>(line 2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for vertex in triangle:</g><br>
<g>(line 3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if self.ver_index == 0:</g><br>
<g>(line 4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if  count != 0: break</g><br>
<g>(line 5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;count = count + 1</g><br>
<g>(line 6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass</g><br>
<g>(line 7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else:</g><br>
<g>(line 8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if  count > 2: break</g><br>
<g>(line 9) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;count = count + 1</g><br>
<g>(line 10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fixedvertex = quarkx.vect(vertex[1]-int(texWidth*.5), vertex[2]-int(texHeight*.5), 0)</g><br>
<g>(line 11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fixedX, fixedY,fixedZ = view.proj(fixedvertex).tuple</g><br>
<g>(line 12)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cv.line(int(pv2[0]), int(pv2[1]), int(fixedX), int(fixedY))</g><br>

And in the screen shot below you can see these vertex handles for the component <g>deadeye</g> Tris as they
are displayed in both the Model Editors views and its <ref> intro/modeleditor/skinview </ref>. Just remember though, the handles in the
Model Editor views, which move the components mesh for the models shape, are NOT the same handles that are shown on the <ref> intro/modeleditor/skinview </ref>,
which move the <g>unwrapped</g> components mesh for skinning purposes. So one handle type will NOT effect the other.
But both are created and drawn in the same way, they just wind up in different <g>handle lists</g>.
