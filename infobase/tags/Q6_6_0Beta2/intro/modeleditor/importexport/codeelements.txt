title: Writing QuArK Elements into the Code
author: cdunde

First off, a little bit of encouragement. When I first started developing for QuArK I knew absolutely nothing
about Python code writing, not to mention C or C++ as well. So if you know anything about these languages
at all, you are far ahead from where I started. And Python is one of the easiest languages for you to learn.

To begin with, there a numbers of ways to get started. You can look for model importer\exporter files that
someone else has already written to go by as a guide<br>
(no I'm not suggesting that you steal code) or you can look for them written in other computer languages
or you can start from scratch using a model's format doc.<br>
No matter the choice, I highly recommend that you obtain a copy of the model's format documentation as a
guide to go by as you create your own code because many times other files may have parts that have been
left out, skipped over or completely incorrect to start with. The format doc will help you spot these
kinds of situations and avoid a lot of wasted time. Conversely, having other code to go by as a guide,
can help in understanding parts of the documentation when needed.

The example that I am going to be working from is the Quake 2 .md2 model importer file named <g>ie_md2_import.py</g>
which is located in your <g>QuArK\plugins</g> folder, so you should open that file now with any text editor as well.
We won't be covering everything in that file, just certain points as needed.

<a name="fileheader"></a>
<u><b><i>File Header</i></b></u> :<br>
At the very top and bottom of you file you should setup its version control code. This is used by us at QuArK when
you send us a copy to go into the Official Set for distribution with furture releases....you ARE going to share
it with us aren't you? At the very top the header would be as shown below:
<code>
#$Header$


Info = {
   "plug-in":       "ie_md2_importer",
   "desc":          "This script imports a Quake 2 file (MD2), textures, and animations into QuArK for editing.
                     Original code from Blender, md2_import.py, author - Bob Holcomb.",
   "date":          "June 3 2008",
   "author":        "cdunde & DanielPharos",
   "author e-mail": "cdunde@sbcglobal.net",
   "quark":         "Version 6.6.0 Beta 2" }
</code>
What you enter for the <g>Info</g> is up to you but we would like to know who made it and any acknowledgements to
others that might have helped or were authors of files you used as a guide, that's only fair. Then at the very
bottom add the following code for your files history:
<code>
# ----------- REVISION HISTORY ------------
#
# $Log$
# Revision 1.1  2008/07/28 22:40:28  cdunde
# Update
#
#
</code>
The file name <b>MUST</b> start with <b>ie_</b> or it will not show up on the QuArK Importer\Exporter menu,
that is what QuArK uses to identify and load it by. Also, to be consistent with other files please use its
file type, in this case <b>md2</b>, and whether it is an importer or exporter for the rest of its name and
please make two separate files, one for each operation. That way users can tell at a glance that both operations
exist and it's easer for any possible future additions and changes.

<a name="fileimports"></a>
<u><b><i>File Imports</i></b></u> :<br>
The very next thing we need to do is to bring in (<g>import</g>) other files and <g>Python Modules</g> that
we will be using through out this file. Below is the code which does that.
<code>
import struct, sys, os, time, operator
import quarkx
from types import *
import ie_utils
from ie_utils import tobj
from quarkpy.qdictionnary import Strings
</code>
You will see how these are used later on as we go through the code writing process from section to section and
at which time they will be covered as needed.

<a name="logging"></a>
<u><b><i>Logging Implementation</i></b></u> :<br>
QuArK has a built in model importer\exporter logging system that should be added to your file.
By adding this code, a log can be created in various ways, or not at all, depending on the settings you select in the
<a href="intro.configuration.model.html#options">Configuration... > Model > Options > Importers \ Exporters</a>
section. One point about logging, the more that you add the slower the operation of importing or exporting can
become, so try to keep it to valid and critical areas only without repeating data logging. When the logging
option is turned off it has very little effect on the operations.

The working code for this system is in the <g>QuArK\plugins\ie_utils.py</g> file, where other useful functions and
utilities should be added that strictly relate to the importers and exporters only.
Now, for adding the code, this is also shown in the <g>QuArK\plugins\ie_utils.py</g> file. Be sure to change the
names in step (1) for <g>exportername</g> and <g>textlog</g> to your file name and type.
<code>
1) To add logging to an importer or exporter put these lines near the top, under the file header, in this order:
import os, time, operator
import ie_utils
from ie_utils import tobj

# Globals
logging = 0
exportername = "ie_md2_export.py" (or importername = "ie_md2_import.py" depending on which one you're doing)
textlog = "md2_ie_log.txt"

2) Then add needed globals and calls to start and end the logging in your main file function like this:
def save_md2(filename):
    global tobj, logging, exportername, textlog ### Needed globals.
    ### Next line starts the logging.
    ### Use "EX" for exporter text, "IM" for importer text.
    logging, tobj, starttime = ie_utils.default_start_logging(exportername, textlog, filename, "EX")

    ### Line below here saves the model (just for this example---DO NOT COPY NEXT LINE).
    fill_md2(md2, component)

    ### Next line is optional, it adds additional text at the bottom of the default message,
    ### with a blank line between them. If none then just exclude it from the function arguments below.
    add_to_message = "Any used skin textures that are not a .pcx\nwill need to be created to go with the model"
    ### Next line ends the logging.
    ### Use "EX" for exporter text, "IM" for importer text.
    ie_utils.default_end_logging(filename, "EX", starttime, add_to_message)


3) Then in any function you want logging declair the global and call for tobj like this: (all items must be strings)
def fill_md2(md2, component):
    global tobj
    if logging == 1:
        tobj.logcon ("#####################################################################")
        tobj.logcon ("Skins group data: " + str(md2.num_skins) + " skins")
        tobj.logcon ("#####################################################################")
        tobj.logcon ("")
</code>
You can use <g>tobj.logcon</g> for a word search in any of the importer\exporter files to see how step (3) is applied.

<a name="pathchecking"></a>
<u><b><i>Path Checking Implementation</i></b></u> :<br>
Now to start the working part of your file. This is another function which is also located in the
<g>QuArK\plugins\ie_utils.py</g> file. It's purpose is to test for a proper model path, meaning that games setup
what you would call a folder path hierarchy for their files to keep things organized and working properly in the game.
Some models store this information within the model file itself especially when it comes to the skin texture(s) they use.
So it is always best to try and work under these same conditions when importing or exporting a model file.

For example, say you have the game setup for <g>Quake 2</g>, its full path to the actual game files folder might be
<g>C:\Program Files\Quake2\baseq2</g>. This is where you would find the <g>.pak</g> files for <g>Quake 2</g>.
If you open a couple of those you would see more folders inside them shuch as <g>models/monsters/boss1</g>
and finally the actual model file, <g>tris.md2</g>, inside that last folder. The <g>valid path</g> for that model
would then be what is shown within the <g>.pak</g> file itself <g>models/monsters/boss1</g> and that is all that
this function is checking for. To import or export a modle these folders <b>MUST</b> be extracted, copied, from the
<g>.pak</g> file to the game folder exactly the same way they are arranged in the <g>.pak</g> file or things may not
work right later. Therefore, you can have, what I call a dummy folder, anywhere else on your drive and do the same
extraction to that folder to work from, but again using their same exact folder path hierarchy.
This helps to ensure that things should work fine later.

If you already did the <a href="#logging">Logging Implementation</a> above you do not need to do step (1) here.
<code>
1) To add path checking to an importer or exporter put this line near the top:
import ie_utils

2) Call for the path check like this:
def loadmodel(root, filename, gamename, nomessage=0):
    ### First we test for a valid (proper) model path.
    basepath = ie_utils.validpath(filename)
    if basepath is None:
        return
</code>
If you look near the bottom of the <g>ie_md2_import.py</g> file you will see the above <g>def loadmodel</g> code
along with some more code in that function. So now with the <a href="#fileheader">File Header</a> code in, <a href="#logging">Logging Implementation</a>
and <a href="#pathchecking">Path Checking Implementation</a> from above completed, we can now go on to the actual importing code below.
