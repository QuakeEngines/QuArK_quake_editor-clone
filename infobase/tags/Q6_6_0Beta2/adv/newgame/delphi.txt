title: Delphi coding

At the minimum, there will have to be a gamecode for the game, defined
in the source file prog/Setup.pas.  Presently these are single-character
alphanumerics assigned on the basis of what kind of engine is used:
<UL>
<LI>1-9: Quake 1/HL</LI>
<LI>A-Z: Quake 2</LI>
<LI>a-z: Quake 3 & other advanced</LI>
</UL>
A complete list of the gamecodes that have been check out thus far is given in
the GameCodeList.txt file located in QuArK's main runtime folder.  As people
use these codes this text file should be updated and committed to the CVS
archives to maintain control and avoid confutation.

Engines that do use shaders and might acquire curves should go into the
last range (Quake 3 & other advanced).

If the game has technology similar to one already supported by QuArK, then
this may well be all that's necessary in the Delphi code, and one of the
current Delphi coders will be able to do it for you.  Otherwise there may
need to be coding for texture-display, model-viewing, terrain editing etc.,
and you might have to do some or even most of it yourself.
