title: Classic Quake

The 'Classic Quake' face format is three parenthesized 3-vectors to
specify three points defining the plane, then the texture name,
and then five numbers being texture shift (2) rotation (1) and scale (2).
E.g.
<code>
  ( 432 0 96 ) ( 432 128 96 ) ( 560 0 96 ) bricka2_2 -432 0 0 1 1 
</code>
This is Quake; other games elaborate on this by putting various things
after the five numbers, such as in Q2/3 the three fields (Content, Flags,
Value) etc. (you can get an idea of the variations by studying the
SaveAsMapTextTFace procedure in QkQuakeMap).
The way the five numbers work is that one imagines the texture as being
plastered onto whatever of the three axis-planes is closest to parallel
to the face, and then as being projected on the face, after being shifted,
rotated and scaled as specified by the numbers.

This scheme has its advantages and disadvantages, which we will not go into
here, but another question is why use nine numbers to specify a plane when four
can actually do it? (three to specify a direction that the plane is
perpendicular to, a fourth to specify the distance from the origin that you go
in that direction to get to the plane).  The answer I think is that by
using nine numbers you can specify a lot of different planes using only
integers, whereas a four-number scheme would involve one in the tricky
world of floating point and roundoff errors.

Anyway, this texture positioning scheme has difficulties with certain kinds
of configurations, such as unpredictable results for faces making 45 degree
angles to the axes, amd also makes it difficult to cause textures to move
with faces when objects are shifted (since the textures are basically
connected with axis planes, and projected onto the faces).
