title: Mappings & Matrices

Technically, a linear mapping is a function making vectors
from vectors that obeys this law, where L is the mapping,
a and b are numbers (scalars), and v and w are vectors:
<code>
L(a*v + b*w) = a*L(v) + b*L(w)
</code>

It is an immedidate consequence of the definition that if [x,
y, z] are the coordinates of a vector v w.r,t, a basis xb,
yb, zb, then the result of L on v can be predicted from v's
coordinates, plus what v does to the vectors of the basis:
<code>
L(v) = x*L(xb), y*L(yb), z*L(zb)
</code>
We can say that [L(xb), L(yb), L(zb)] are a 'replacement
basis' for the original basis (this isn't a standard term,
but I think it fits).  There's one respect in which a
replacement basis isn't like real basis: its vectors can
all lie in the same plane or line, or even be 0

Not only does every linear mapping produce a replacement
basis, but the reverse is true: if we pick three vectors
at random, [xr, yr, zr], we can make a linear mapping out
of them by choosing a (real) basis, and then transforming
a vector v with coordinates &lt;x, y, z> as follows:
<code>
M(v) = x*xr + y*yr + z*zr
</code>
If you crank thru the algebra you'll see that M is a linear
mapping.  So for a given basis we've decided to use,
every linear mapping produces a (unique) replacement basis, and
every replacement basis produces a (unique) linear mapping.

This is very nice, because a linear mapping is a sort of
abstract transformation of space, but a replacement basis
is just a sequence of vectors.  And if we're doing 3D
math, it will just be nine numbers.  And there is
a convenient package for delivering these numbers in, a
matrix.  A matrix is in general just a grid of numbers,
m rows and n columns, for basic 3D math we're interested
in 3x3 matrices.

In the standard presentation, the first, second and third
columns of the matrix represent the first, second and
third members of the replacement basis (important: columns,
not rows).  QuArK python conforms to this in that
if the arguments of quarkx.matrix(...) are three vectors,
they will be taken to be the columns of the matrix (whereas
if the input is tuples or a string, it's row-by-rlow).

Then the rules of matrix multiplication have been set up
so that if M is a matrix and v is a vector (thought of
as a single column, constituting a 1-column matrix),
M*v is the result of applying the mapping represented
by M to v. Technically, these columns (both the columns
of the matrix representing the linear mapping and the
single columns representing the vectors), are taken to
be the coordinates of vectors (the input and output vectors,
and the replacement basis vectors) with respect to some
basis.  But in QuArK Python (and other computational vector
and matrix sytems) we don't have to worry about this kind
of thing, since we're taking the standard basis as the
fundamental one.

Most of the time the basis we're most interested in is
the standard one, which I'll repeat here:
<code>
xa = &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;
ya = &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;
za = &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;
</code>
