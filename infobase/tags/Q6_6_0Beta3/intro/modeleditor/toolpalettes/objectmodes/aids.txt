<b><u>Visual Aids</u></b>:<br>
Applying to all of the <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html">QuArK Quick Object Makers</a>,
a number of visual aids have been added to enhance their features. These are covered below in relation to the
screen shot also shown below. As a general statement, all objects shapes and changes are shown during the entire
dragging process in all of the 2D and 3D views as redline objects. Once this process is completed they are 'dropped'
into these views as model objects with triangular faces and become part of the currently selected model component
with the 'Default' skinning texture applied, which will need to be adjusted in the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>.

<i>Ruler guide in 2D views:</i> This function has been incorporated to show dimensions as a drag is taking place
and upon its completion as well. The 'Rulers' are fully dependent on their normal
<a href="intro.modeleditor.menu.html#optionsmenu">view function controls</a> and can be turned on or off for each
individual 2D view as desired. While a drag is in progress the rulers text size will show slightly smaller then
that of existing component items, which will retain their own measurement display.

<i>Starting point marker:</i> At the beginning of each drag a <font color="BLUE">blue target marker</font>
is created to designate that position in the 2D dragging view. Because a poly can not be constructed with less
than three faces, objects will not be drawn until, holding down the <g>LMB</g>, the cursor has moved at least
three vertical scale grid sections away from this target position and either to the left or right of it.
For every grid unit the cursor moves away vertically (up or down) from this target an additional section of faces,
and in some cases an additional section, will be added to the object. When the cursor is moved horizontally
(left or right) from the target the object will increase in size. The reverse also holds true. To keep from
creating an object, to change its distortion settings or cancel its creation, simple move within the 'no draw'
zone and release the mouse button.

<i>Segment\Face indicator:</i> As a drag takes place a <font color="GREEN">green  label</font> and
<font color="GREEN">cross hairs</font> are also displayed and updated to indicate the number of segments
(sections) in some cases and faces. As the amounts increase and decrease, the label will change color from
<font color="GREEN">green</font> to <font color="FUSHA">fuchsia</font> to <font color="PURPLE">purple</font>
to <font color="RED">red</font> indicating a possible program performance slowdown and excessive faces for game use.
In the case of the <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html">Sphere object</a>, any amount over
fifteen faces, in the <font color="PURPLE">purple</font> to <font color="RED">red</font> range, will cause a
program slowdown and possible temporary freezing. However, it will return to finish the object if so desired.
Otherwise, just move the cursor back below the <font color="PURPLE">purple</font> zone and continue when it
returns active.


<b><u>Misc. Info</u></b>:<br>
A couple of brief extra points on the use of the
<a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html">QuArK Quick Object Makers</a> are given here, below.

<i>Special vertex dragging</i>:<br>
As mentioned earlier in the <ref> ./pyramid_cone </ref> section above, movement of an objects <g>vertex</g>
using the standard method may cause unwanted distortion. If so, try using the special <g>vertex</g> dragging
function as described in the <ref> ./pyramid_cone </ref> section.

<i>Grid Scale effects</i>:<br>
Changing the <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.display.html#grid">Grid Scale settings</a> will have a
direct effect on both the size of the objects and the scale of their skin texture, which is always the
currently selected skin texture of the model component.
