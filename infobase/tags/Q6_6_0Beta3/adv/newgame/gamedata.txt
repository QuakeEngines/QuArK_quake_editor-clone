title: Game Data Addons
author: tiglari

Finally you need to make addons for the game data.  There are several
of these:

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>

<tr><td>
DataXXX.qrk
</td><td>
Where XXX is your game's <b>abbreviated</b> name. This file contains the main info about the game, like some settings and the default room.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
XXXEntities.qrk<br>
XXXMaterials.qrk<br>
XXXModels.qrk<br>
XXXShaders.qrk<br>
XXXScripts.qrk<br>
XXXSounds.qrk<br>
XXXTextures.qrk<br>
</td><td>
Where XXX is the full game name. These files contain the main data about the game.<br>
Note: not all files are needed for all games.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
UserData XXX.qrk
</td><td>
Where XXX is the full game name. This files contains some additional settings for QuArK for this game, like pre-fab object that can be dropped into the map, and the default settings for the build-menu.
</td></tr>

</table>

The easiest way to make these is by copying ones from a similar game, and then
adding/changing things to suit (the game abbreviation for starters).

A workable texture toolbox for SoF2 is:
<code>
  Textures.qtx =
  {
    Toolbox = "Texture Browser..."
    Root = "SoF2 Textures.qtxfolder"
    SoF2 Textures.qtxfolder =
    {
      Textures and Shaders.osfolder =
      {
        path = "base"
      }
    }
  }
</code>
This will load up textures dynamically from the <g>.PK3</g> folders. For
better performance, you can use the 'make texture links' button in the texture
toolbox and check 'static' to produce a list of the textures in the .PK3's.

<ul><u>
<li>Access of Mod & Custom Textures
</u><br>
</ul>

Another way of setting up access to textures for Mods and Custom Textures
is to set the "path" to that specific Mod folder and use the blanket
command name "build" with a value of "1" setting as shown in the example
below for the Mod "ET", a Quake 3 base game:
<code>
{
  Description = "Enemy Terror Add-on"
  Game Context.qctx =
  {
    Game = "Quake 3"
    SourceDir = "ET"
    GameDir = "baseq3"
  }
  Textures.qtx =
  {
    ToolBox = "Texture Browser..."
    Root = "ET (Enemy Terror).qtxfolder"
    ET (Enemy Terror).qtxfolder =
    {
      ET Textures & Shaders.osfolder =
      {
        path = "ET"
        build = "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>
Basically what this does is tell QuArK to search the given path folder for
all texture folders and files in all .pak files, no matter what their name
is, and folders that have been named "textures" and, if the game supports
them, "scripts" which are shader texture files like the ones used in Quake 3.

In addition, any custom textures and shader files will also be included
that are placed in the "textures" and "scripts" folders or in their own
sub-folder placed in these folders, with any name you wish to give them.
These custom sub-folders can also have sub-folder within them as well for
a better grouping of files. All of the folders will then be grouped in the
<ref> ../../intro/texturebrowser/overview \ Texture Browser </ref> under the
caption "Directories" and will be displayed by their individual folder and
sub-folder names.


For entities, if the game has a <g>.DEF</g> or <g>.FGD</g> file, you can use the
<act>File|Convert from</act> facility from the QuArK-Explorer main menu, to produce a basic entity toolbox entry
which in the case of SoF2 might start look like this:
<code>
  SoF2Entities.qtx =
  {
    ToolBox = "New map items..."
    Root = "SoF2 Entities.qtxfolder"
    SoF2 Entities.qtxfolder =
    {
      ;desc = "Created from entities.def"
      func_* entities.qtxfolder =
      .
      .
    }
  }
</code>
Whatever you get should be substituted for the entity toolbox folder in
the file you're copying from, and later edited by hand to add missing entities,
improve help, etc.

More info about the converters and their options can be found here: <ref> ../conversion </ref>
