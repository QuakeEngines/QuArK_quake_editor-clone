title: Disablers

Now for something a bit harder, which is to cause the menu
items to become `disabled' (light grey and unresponsive)
when they can't do anything useful.  The technique for doing
this depends on the fact hat menu items are full-fledged
objects and can have any kind of data attached to them.
Furthermore there is an attribute `.state' with these values
defined in quarkpy.qmenu.py:
<code>
# menu state
normal     = 0
checked    = 2
radiocheck = 3
disabled   = 4    # can be added to the above
default    = 8    # can be added to the above
</code>
Menu items are created in a normal state; all we have to
do to disable them is to change their state to disabled.

These means first giving them names, then using those names
when we append them to the command menu:
<code>
mentagside  = qmenu.item("&Tag Side", tagSideClick)
menglueside = qmenu.item("&Glue to Tagged", glueSideClick)
</code>
<code>
quarkpy.mapcommands.items.append(qmenu.sep)   # separator
quarkpy.mapcommands.items.append(mentagside)
quarkpy.mapcommands.items.append(menglueside)
</code>
For brevity, we've dropped the help text.  But we've
also added a `separator', to make things look more organized.

Our next trick is a bit deeper.  The `mapcommands' object in quarkpy
has a `method' (some functions or procedures associated with the
object), called `onclick', which does stuff when the commands
menu is activated, before the items on it actually get displayed.
What we're going to do is to redefine this method.  Some code that
does this is:
<code>
def commandsclick(menu, oldcommand=quarkpy.mapcommands.onclick):
    oldcommand(menu)
</code>
<code>
quarkpy.mapcommands.onclick = commandsclick
</code>
First we define our new onclick function, calling it `commandsclick' for
the moment.  It takes an optional parameter `oldcommand', which is equated
by default to the current quarkpy.mapcommands.onclick (this is a basic
technique for redefining things from quarkpy).  What it does (for now)
is execute the old method.  I tried to get it to display a message box,
but for some unknown reason that trashed the display of the menu, so
I commented it out.  Finally we equate quarkpy.madpcommands.onclick
to our new commandsclick function.  You should now test this to make
sure nothing has gotten accidently broken, and then we'll move on to
making it do something.

But maybe I should first say a bit about what's really going
on.  In the running of a Python program, the first time a module
is imported, the statements in it are executed.  The
<tt>def</tt> and <tt>class</tt> statements cause things
to get defined, but you can write code to do anything
you like.  Subsequent
imports of a module don't re-execute its statements, they
just make the stuff defined in the module available, not
only for `read' access, but also for `write' access
(redefinition).  This makes plugins extremely powerful,
and is described in the Python documentation as a rather
dangerous practice, but it seems to work out OK, the way
it's managed in QuArK.

But now what we want to do of course is check for the preconditions of our two
menu items.  For side-tagging, we want the selection to consist of
exactly one side.  If this is true, we want the menu state to be normal,
otherwise disabled.  Here's some code that does it:
<code>
def selFace(editor):
    sel = editor.layout.explorer.sellist
    if len(sel)!=1 or sel[0].type!=":f":
        return None
    return sel[0]
</code>
<code>
def commandsclick(menu, oldcommand=quarkpy.mapcommands.onclick):
    editor = mapeditor()
    if editor is None: return
    oldcommand(menu)
    mentagside.state = qmenu.normal
    sel = selFace(editor)
    if sel is None:
        mentagside.state = qmenu.disabled
</code>
We can now remove the checks & message boxes from the
tagSideClick code (tho it might be sensible to leave them in for
a while to make sure our disabler is really picking up on all the
preconditions).

The next step is to extend commandsclick to test whether the gluing
command is applicable.  Working out all of the conditions is a bit
tricky, here's something that seems to be OK:
<code>
def commandsclick(menu, oldcommand=quarkpy.mapcommands.onclick):
    editor = mapeditor()
    if editor is None: return
    oldcommand(menu)
    mentagside.state = menglueside.state = qmenu.normal
    sel = selFace(editor)
    if sel is None:
        mentagside.state = qmenu.disabled
        menglueside.state = qmenu.disabled
    tagged = gettagged(editor)
    if tagged is None:
        menglueside.state = qmenu.disabled
    elif sel == tagged:
        menglueside.state = mentagside.state = qmenu.disabled
</code>
Now we've lost a little bit, because there aren't any more
explanations of what the problem is when the user tries to
do the wrong thing.  So the conditions under which the
menu item can be used should be explained in its hint.

It is also, in my experience, rather tricky to work out the
conditions under which items should be disabled, & the code
tends to get fragile.  So it's good if the operations check
that they're not going to cause trouble before proceeding.

A further possibility is to dynamically adjust the hint, by writing
code that says things like:
<code>
    hint = "|This menu item is disabled because ..."+hint[1:]
</code>
There is an example of this in the function curvemenu in
plugins/mb2curves.py.  Hey, it begins with `mb2', and
yet loads as a plugin!  That's because things to do with
bezier curves, that are only useful with Q3A-engine games,
should be put into plugins starting with `mb2'.

A possible project would be to enhance the `tagging.py' module
with some code that put into the tagging object info about the
unsuccessful attempts to retrieve various kinds of tagged things;
this info could then be used to add information to hints.
