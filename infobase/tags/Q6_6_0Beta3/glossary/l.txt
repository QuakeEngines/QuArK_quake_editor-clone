<dt><a name="leak">     </a>Leak        <dd>The most annoying thing you get, when building <a href="#bsp">bsp</a>-maps! A leak (or hole as it is also called), is a place in your map that has a view out to the <a href="#void">void</a>.<br>Think of you map as a giant enclosed bathtub filled with water. If there is a leak somewhere, the water would pour out (even run upwards if you got a leak in the ceiling!), and this prevents the VIS/QVIS program to optimize your map.<br>If your level got a leak, even just a tiny small one, it's a <u>bad</u> map! So compile often to catch leaks.
