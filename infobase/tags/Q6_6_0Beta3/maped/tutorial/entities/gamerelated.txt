title: Game related entities and arguments
author: Decker

As much as QuArK helps you along the way, giving you a wide array of entities,
and within them their specifics and argument, you have to seek information
about how to use the entities yourself, by;

<ul>
<li>reading documents and tutorials,
<li>searching the web,
<li>asking for help in news-groups and mailing-lists,
<li>study entities in <g>.MAP</g> and <g>.BSP</g> files made by other people
<li>and generally THINK, EXPERIMENT and LEARN.
</ul>

You will find out that, even though the games that QuArK supports, are all
based on the Quake-engine series by <g>id Software</g>, some entities do not
act in the same way. An example:

<blockquote>
Creating a semi-transparent window...
<ul>
<li>Quake-1: You can't! However, there is a way to make an invisible inpassable window, but it will bleed when shot upon.
<li>Quake-2, Heretic-II, Sin: The face-flags controls whether the brush is transparent or not.
<li>Half-Life: Can only be created by brush-entities. Some special specifics/args controls the transparency.
<li>Hexen-II: I don't know, but the game is based on the Quake-1 engine, so the same thing might apply.
<li>Quake-3 Arena: Use or create a <g>shader</g>, to be applied on the brush.
</ul>

The more information you seek out, the better equiped you are to make good maps.

Okay enough of that. Lets put a light-source into your first room. I'm not
going to tell you how, because as stated above; Think, Experiment and Learn.

Once you have put that light-source into your room, you are ready to build
(compile) your map, and test it in the game. To build, you have several options
in the game menu in the map-editor; <tt>GO!</tt>, <tt>QuickGO!</tt> and
<tt>Complete rebuild</tt>.

I suggest you activate the <tt>QuickGO!</tt> function, as this will; make QuArK
export a .MAP file, run some of the build-programs, and then start the game you
have choosen from QuArK Explorer Games menu.

Errors might appear, like you haven't told QuArK where it can find the
build-programs, then go to the <ref> intro/configuration/games </ref> for the
choosen game, and correct the problem.

Other errors can come from the build process, and here you have to find out
what is wrong, and try to fix it yourself
(see also <ref> intro/basicknowledge/compilingmaps </ref>). Of course, if its way
over your head, you can write a message to the <link forums>QuArK-forum</link> asking
for help. Just make sure you have supplied enough documentation on the error
you get, so others can understand your problem.
