<b>Question:</b><br>
How do I create a transparent breakable window in Half-Life? Or just a transparent object?

<b>Answer:</b><br>
It is only possible to create transparent objects in Half-Life, by using brush-entities.

Most brush-entities in Half-Life, have some
"render<i>xxx</i>&nbsp;" specifics.
It is these that are used to tell the game-engine, that this brush
should be drawn transparent or do other special effects.

To set a func_wall half-transparent, you have to set these two specifics in the brush-entity:
<code>
rendermode      TEXTURE
renderamt       128
</code>

If you want a breakable transparent window, use the func_breakable brush-entity, and besides the two mentioned specifics, you
also have to set those specifics that makes it a breakable object.
