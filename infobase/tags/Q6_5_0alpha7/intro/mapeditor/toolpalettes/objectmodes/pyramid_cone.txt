<I><u>Quick pyramid-cone maker</u></I>:  After you click this button, you can draw pyramids-cones on the map with the <g>LMB</g> and each object will be turned into an actual poly.

The more sides that are added the more it becomes a cone shape.<br>
Move the mouse forward to add more faces, backwards for fewer faces, right to make it larger and left to make it smaller.<br>NOTE: Less than 3 faces will not draw anything.

Once the object has been created you might have to use the special <g>vertex</g> movement function to stretch or reduce its size by dragging its top point common <g>vertex</g>.
To use this function simply hold down the <b>' n '</b> HotKey when you select, drag and release the <g>LMB</g>.

For some reason, you only need to do this the first time the common <g>vertex</g> is dragged. Afterwards the <g>vertex</g> can be moved correctly, without using the special function, in the normal manner of just holding the cursor over the <g>vertex</g>, pressing the <g>LMB</g> and dragging it. Using the special function above without actually dragging the <g>vertex</g> will also create the same results.

Increasing the amount of its <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html#dialogboxes"><i>Object Distortion Dialog</i></a> will increase its height.<br>
Giving a negative amount will make it shorter.
