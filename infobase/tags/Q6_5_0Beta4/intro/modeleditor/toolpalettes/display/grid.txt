There are two parts to this button. The left will bring down the menu, where
you will be able to select what grid-scale you want to work in. The right part
will enable/disable the grid, so you can work freely if needed.

You can also use keys to increase or decrease the grid. See
<ref> intro/configuration/map/keys </ref> for these.
