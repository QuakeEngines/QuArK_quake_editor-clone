title: Patch Basics
author: tiglari

A basic patch (there are also composite patches that we call 'quilts') can
be thought of as a squarish sheet of material stretched out by a 3x3 grid
of 9 'control points'.  To make one, start a basic map and click on the
patch icon in the user panel (labelled 'bezier'). You will then see a grid
of colored control points drop into the overhead view of the map:

<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0>
<tr><td align=middle>
<pic> bez1.png </pic>
</td><td align=middle>
<pic> bez2.png </pic>
</td></tr>
</table>

The (here horizontal) lines of control points of the same hue are the rows,
the vertical ones are the columns.  The points get darker as you move along
the rows up from index zero.  If you leave the cursor
sitting over a control point for a while, a rather large
flyover hint appears, beginning with the control point's row
and column indexes, and giving rather extensive information about
stuff you can do.

The black dot is a handle which can be used to move the whole patch, and
also has a few RMB (Right Menu Button) commands.

Now the patch is 'anchored' at the corners, in the
sense that if you drag a corner point, the patch is pulled out
with it, but it is only 'attracted' by the non-corner points;
if one of them is dragged, the patch pulls out towards it,
but does not stay attached.  This effect also appears with
3-dimensional movement, as you can see by opening a 3d view
and playing around with it:

<table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0>
<tr><td align=middle>
<pic> bez3.png </pic>
</td><td align=middle>
<pic> bez4.png </pic>
</td></tr>
</table>

If you play around with the patch and then run the map
in Quake3, you'll find that the patch displays a texture
on only one side, and also only blocks movement on that
side, an fact which could be used to make some rather
annoying effects in maps.

There is quite a bit more to patches, as we will see
more of below, but direct patch
editing is slow and difficult, and not a good way to approach
basic tasks such as making archways and rounded corners.
For these purposes we instead use
