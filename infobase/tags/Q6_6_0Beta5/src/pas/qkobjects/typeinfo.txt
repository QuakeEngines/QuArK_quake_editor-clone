title: TypeInfo
author: Tiglari / Armin

This class method simply returns the 'extension' of the object. For files, it's
the usual extension with the dot; for non-file objects, it should begin with
'<tt>:</tt>' (colon). For example for TTreeMapEntity it is '<tt>:e</tt>'. This
is a class function, but it is virtual; it's a feature that I've only seen
possible in Delphi, not in C++. This lets the code below in QkObjects.pas build
a list of all the classes ("pointer to class" is something the C++ doesn't know
about) and when loading a object from a file or from inside a file we compare
the end of the name with all the TypeInfo's of the classes to know which class
should be the object we're about to build.
