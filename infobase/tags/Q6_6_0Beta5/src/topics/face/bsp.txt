title: In the BSP

This is of course the fundamental one.  For Q1/2 it's two 4-vectors, uaxis,uoffset;
vaxis, voffset, with this formula for computing the texture-coordinates
for a point in the map space (only points on the face being relevant,
of course):
<code>
   u = x * u_axis.x + y * u_axis.y + z * u_axis.z + u_offset
   v = x * v_axis.x + y * v_axis.y + z * v_axis.z + v_offset
</code>

With Q3 otoh, the texture-coordinates of each vertex of the face are
given, as a five-vector, along with the spatial coordinates (5-space
math, for L.M.Bujold fans!).  See
<a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~kekoa/q3/"> 
Kekoa Proudfoot Unofficial Quake3 Map Specs</a>.  This representation
is rather redundant for brush-faces, but extends gracefully to patches.

In QkBsphulls.pas there is code for converting both the Q1/2 and Q3 .bsp
representations to QuArK's.  A call of <strong>SolveForThreePoints</strong>
does the job for Q3; Q1/2 are handled by some equation-solving code
directly above that.
