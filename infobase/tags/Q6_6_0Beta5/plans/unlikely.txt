These are things that could be done but probably won't be, unless a coder
comes along who wants to do them.  If no explanation is provided, the
explanation is an unfavorable apparent demand/probable effort ration.

<UL>
<li>Edit textures in .bsp files:
<br>an as-yet-unimplemented 4.7 feature, unlikely to be implemented
since it makes it too easy to rip off other people's work.

<li>Map reconstructor for Q3 engine games:
<br>This might be easier to do well for Q3 engine
games because the model structure seems to include
brush info as well as face info.  But same problem as Edit textures
in .bsp above.

<li>Daikatana support: (?)

<li>Adquedit-equivalent resource display for Q1: (Seth)
<br>That is, edit *all* Q1 engine game resources.  This might
become more viable if QuArK gets involved in the Q1-engine source
port scene.

<li>OsFolders: (tiglari)
<br>edit the properties of pre-existing OsFolders
