Features added to this and previous versions of QuArK,
and proposed for the future.  A big uncertainty factor is
the QuArKplusplus project, to translate QuArK into C++ and
use Crystal Space as the 3d view rendering engine; the more
ambitious suggestions especially might well be overtaken by
this project.

Don't forget to look in the 'NEWS.txt' file in the main
QuArK directory for a more detailed list of new features
and fixes!
