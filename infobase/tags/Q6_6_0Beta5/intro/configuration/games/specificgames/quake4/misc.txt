<b>Changing and re-running a map</b>

Normally, I run Quake 4 in a separate window, instead of its "Full Screen" mode when working on
a map, for a couple of reasons. First it's a lot easer to see around to view something in the
editor that you might be concentrating on with your work. The other is being able to jump back
and forth between the editor and the game running by simply holding down the Alt key and
pressing the Tab key to switch. It seems less confusing that way.

Another nice feature is the ability to make changes in your map while the game is still running
and then simply rebuild and reload the map. This is done by clicking the same menu item in QuArK
to export the map, then click on the game, press the Tilde ~ key and enter the two commands to
build and run it again. If you stayed with the default name they would look like this:

<i>dmap newmap

devmap newmap</i>

And Walla, your changes appear in the game! This method saves a lot of time of constantly having
to restart the game and wait for it to build and load the map again. But you can also do it that
way as well if you like. Just click the QuArK menu item and off you go. To close the game,
press the Esc key and select "Exit" from its menu.

If, for some reason, the map does not build and run automatically, then you will need to bring down
the game console twice and enter the above commands by hand.
