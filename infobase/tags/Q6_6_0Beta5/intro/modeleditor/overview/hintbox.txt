Whenever you see the text "<tt>Press <b>F1</b> for help</tt>" in the little
hintbox under the <a href="#dataform">dataform-display</a>, you can press F1
and get a Hint Pop-up window, which tells you a little more about the item
you are pointing at. This is its primary function.

Many of the Hint Pop-up windows will have an InfoBase button that is linked
directly to a page in the InfoBase and will give you further help for the
item in question. Clicking that button or pressing <b>F1</b> again will open that page.

If you are new to QuArK, these hints and InfoBase links come in handy if you
do not know exactly what the item you are pointing at, does. So press <b>F1</b> to
get the hint and information available, before asking about it in the
<link forums>QuArK Forum</link>.

Once you move your mouse outside the larger hintbox, it will automatically
disappear.

The <b>Hintbox</b> also has a secondary function, that of displaying useful
informaiton as to the view you are in, the location of your cursor and certain
items it is over such as a model mesh face (triangle) or drag handle. It will also display
your cursor co-ordinances at the start of a drag and your current drag position to assist
in the positioning of those drag handles. This also applies to the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view page</a> to aid in the <g>skinning</g>
process of a model.
