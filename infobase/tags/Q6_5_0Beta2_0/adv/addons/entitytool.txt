title: Using the entity extractor.
author: Andy

The easiest & probably the quickest way to create a QuArK addon for an existing mod is to use the entity extractor. This basically searches thourgh the existing <g>.bsp</g> files and creates an addon based upon any new entities found.<br>
<br>
It is best to use a "Game Context" which tell QuArK which game the addon if for and which directories to look in for game files. To create on of these, first create a new file <act>File|New File</act>, then create a "Game Context", <act>Toolboxes|New Files...</act> and double click on "Game Context". Your QuArK window should look something like this:<br>

<br>
<br>
Next, you need to specify the game and mod directories you want (for example, Game: Quake 1, Source Dir: Slide, Game Dir: Slide). Then click the "Get entities for this game" button. The new entities will then be found, and some texture links made. Note: this may take a long time depending on the mod's size and the number of .bsp files found.<br>
