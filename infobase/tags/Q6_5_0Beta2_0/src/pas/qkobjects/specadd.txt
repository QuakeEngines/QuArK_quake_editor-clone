title: SpecificsAdd
author: Armin Rigo

Normally, Specifics are read and written through the Specifics property of
objects, which is a Delphi string list, meaning you can do things such as
<tt>Specifics['x']:='yz';</tt> to assign the value 'yz' to the specific called
'x'. This actually adds the string 'x=yz' to the list, unless 'x' had already
been set to some value previously, in which case it just replaces the existing
'x=...' string with 'x=yz'.

Note that <tt>Specifics['x']:='';</tt> will remove an existing 'x=...' string,
and never add a string with just 'x='.

Adding a specific/arg pair directly is also possible :
<tt>Specifics.Add('x=yz')</tt> has the same effect as above, but it does not
check for a previously set value, so it must not be used unless you are sure
this value does not already exist.

At some point, it might be more efficient (for small specific/args) to use
<tt>SpecificsAdd(...)</tt> instead of <tt>Specifics.Add(...)</tt>.
<tt>SpecificsAdd</tt> is a method of QObject. The whole purpose of this routine
and its asm code is to spare memory when loading a file : some specifics are
repeated numerous times, e.g. in a map a string like "tex=gothic_a1" will
appear dozens of times. As Delphi knows about reference-counted strings, what
this code does is look for another already existing string which would be
identical, and if it finds it, it is reused (and its reference counter is
incremented).
