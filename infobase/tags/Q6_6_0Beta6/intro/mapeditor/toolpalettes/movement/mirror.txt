These buttons will mirror your selection, around its common center. To see the
common center of your selected object(s), you must be able to see the

The icons from left to right:
<ul>
<li><i>X-symmetry</i>. Mirror around the selection's common X-axis.
<li><i>Y-symmetry</i>. Mirror around the selection's common Y-axis.
<li><i>Z-symmetry</i>. Mirror around the selection's common Z-axis.
</ul>
