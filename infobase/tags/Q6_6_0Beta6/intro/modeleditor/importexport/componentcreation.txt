title: Creating a Component in the Code
author: cdunde

In one of our previous functions, <a href="#import_md2_model2">import_md2_model</a>,
we had the data to create a component returned to that function.
Here we will look at its code, which is shown below, to see exactly how that is written.
<code>
    # Now we can name our component that will be imported.
    Component = quarkx.newobj(name + ':mc')
    Component['skinsize'] = skinsize
    Component['Tris'] = Tris
    Component['show'] = chr(1)
    sdogroup = quarkx.newobj('SDO:sdo')
    Component.appenditem(sdogroup)
    Component.appenditem(skingroup)
    Component.appenditem(framesgroup)
</code>
<a name="place1"></a>
<g><b>A special note here :</b></g><br>
If you were also importing <a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#bones">Bones</a> or
<a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#boundingboxes">BBoxes</a> (bounding boxes)
from the model this is the first of
<a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#place2">two places</a>
where that code <b>COULD</b> be added if there is only <b>ONE</b> component used for the model.
If there is more then one then they would need to be added at
<a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#bones">the second location</a> as a mater of code consistency.
The additional line of code should be placed just <b>before</b> the <g>Component</g> lines
above and can be copied from below just as it is shown.
<code>
    editor.Root.dictitems['Skeleton:bg'].appenditem(skeletongroup)
</code>
See the section below covering
<a href="intro.modeleditor.importexport.html#bones">Bones Structure, Data within the Bone</a>
for the needed code to create individual bones for the <g>skeletongroup</g> <b>before</b>
the line above is called.

Just under the above code in the <g>QuArK\plugins\ie_md2_import.py</g> file you will see this code.
<code>
    ### Use the 'ModelRoot' below to test opening the QuArK's Model Editor with,
    ### needs to be qualified with main menu item.
    ModelRoot = quarkx.newobj('Model:mr')
