This view actually contains your model which is broken down in different elements
within what are called <g>Component</g> folders, or groups. Each model consist of
various categories and some have sub-categories which in turn may have their own sub-items.

The categories and items in a models Tree-view are:
<ul>
<li><i>Model</i> : The main <g>editor Root</g> of the model that is loaded.
<li><i>Misc</i> : Setup for future <g>Bound Frames</g>, <g>tags</g> and <g>Tag Frames</g> of a model.
<li><i>Skeleton</i> : Contains the <a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#bones">bones</a> to be used for one or more components.
<li><i>Component</i> : The elements of a model's structure folder which can be more then one.
<li><i>Skins</i> : Contains the image file, or files, that can be used for that component.
<li><i>Frames</i> : Contains the <g>animation</g> frames for movement of that component.
</ul>

One important point here is about the <g>Frames</g>. Each component must contain the same number
of frames, arraigned in the same order. They can be moved around to rearrange their order but
remember to keep that the same for each one, this is not done automatically by the editor.
As new components are added they will be created with the same number and arraignment of frames
as the others.

You can right-mouse-click on every tree-view object, to get a context-menu,
from where you can select different actions.

If you wish to enlarge or reduce the Tree-view height, there is a hidden 'drag line' at the very top
of the Tree-view, just below the compass. When your curser changes to two bars, with arrows above
and below them, you can then hold the left mouse button down and drag the Tree-view to the height
you desire.

Just below the Tree-view is the <a href="intro.modeleditor.overview.html#hintbox">Hintbox</a>
which displays various information and informs you by displaying <b>Press F1 for help</b>,
which you should do, when there is information about a functions use and
which in turn usually provides a link to these <g>InfoBase</g> docs section for a more detailed
description and information.
