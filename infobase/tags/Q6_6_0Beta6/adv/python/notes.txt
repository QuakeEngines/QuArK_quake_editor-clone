title: Python Notes
author: Tiglari

Since Python is interpreted, its class system is far more
flexible than C++ or Delphi, and you can do stuff that you
can't even dream of in these languages (some of which is
very useful for GUI-building).  The downside of being
interpreted is that it's relatively slow.

So things that need to be fast are coded in Delphi, and made available
to be called as functions in the Python.  These are both
functions and procedures called as part of the module
<strong>quarkx</strong>, and also attributes and methods
of map objects such as faces, poly's etc. that are defined
in the Delphi code, but need to be accessed from the Python
code as well.

All of the Delphi-defined stuff is all documented in
<ref>src/quarkx</ref> which is a fine reference manual.  The Delphi-defined
stuff integrates very smoothly into Python, and looks native.
So if you can't find a method-name in the Python code,
check the Delphi, starting with the quarkx module.

Although your first Python project will probably be a plugin,
you'll need to use not only quarkx, but also perhaps some of
the facilities in the module <strong>quarkpy</strong>, where
many basic facilities are also defined.  Unfortunately the
contents of quarkpy aren't very well cataloged. Info about
this, such as it is, is in <ref> adv/quarkpy </ref>.
