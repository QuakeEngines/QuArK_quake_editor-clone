<strong>QuarkX functions & None</strong>:
If you write something like:
<code>
    if quarkx.function():
      blah
      blah
</code>

expecting blah blah to not execute when function()
returns None as a value, you'll probably get a bizarre
run-time error.  Instead write:

<code>
    if quarkx.function() is not None:
      blah
      blah
</code>

This is because most of the Python objects implemented in
Delphi do not explicitely support 'truth' evaluation.
Armin thought the Python core would detect it but it
seems it just tries to do the evaluation anyway, thus
calling a Nil function. Everything in Python can be true
or false, including the Delphi-defined objects -- at least
the Python core expects it so, and the Delphi code doesn't
do it right :-(  So always explicitely compare with None.

<strong>Vector equality</strong>:
Don't try to compare QuarkX vectors with equality,
rather test their difference for being zero.  Armin discusses
this in the <ref> src/quarkx </ref> document.

<strong>Tuples & assigment</strong>:
Python has a concept of `tuple', which is a sequence of numbers whose members can't
be changed (they're `immutable').  1-element tuples are
written with a comma after them, which leads to wierd
looking things like:
<code>
  mytuple = mynumber,
</code>
and
<code>
  mynumber, = mytuple
</code>

This latter is an example of `tuple assignment', if the right
hand side of an assignemt is a tuple, then on the left hand side
you can put a tuple-expression, and the appropriate assignments
will get made to its variables.

These commas are a bit unusual and easy to miss at first, and
since many of the most useful specifics in dialog boxes
are of tuple-type, missing them can lead to a lot of frustration.

<strong>Tabs & whitespace</strong>:
One of Python's distinctive features is `whitespace structuring', whereby all members of
the same block have to be indented the same distance, and
sub-blocks are indented more.  This saves hunting around for
matching curlies, but can lead to at least one kind of
serious screwup, involving tabs:  if Python's idea of what
a tab is different from your editors, you can screw up
functioning code just by saving it.  I have my text editor
set to convert all tabs to 4 spaces.
