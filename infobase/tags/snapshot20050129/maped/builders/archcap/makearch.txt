title:  Making an arch

To make an arch, first click on the cube icon in the user
panel, or use whatever technique you normally use to make
a more or less cubical brush.  Then, in a side-on map-view,
select the brush and <act>RMB|Curves|Arch</act>.

An arch-shape will appear inside the brush, and if the brush
isn't selected, it will be invisible. If you open up a 3d view and
look around, you'll see that there are patches with textures
on the front and back, and inside curve.

What's happened is that the original brush has been put
inside a duplicator, which makes it invisible unless selected.
You can see this by looking at the tree view, as illustrated:

The duplicator then controls the production of the actual
patches comprising the arch, by means that we will shortly
start manipulating.

Of course, due to the one-sided visibility of patches, the
arch isn't a very satisfactory piece of archicture until we
put it into a suitable architectural environment.
But first, a bit more about the arch itself.  You might think
that once made, it's made, and what you see is all you get,
but not at all.  First, click on the arch until its `guide brush'
(the one inside its duplicator) is selected.

We can now drag this brush around, and the arch will move, and
we can reproportion the arch by dragging the individual faces.
Since these are ordinary faces, which provide data to the duplicator
code the makes the arch patches, we can do all the ordinary face
stuff to them, such as tag/glue.

So the next step is to make a wall with a hole in it,
using whatever your favorite technique for doing this is (if you
want to live dangerously, you can subtract with the arch brush
before or after turning the original brush
into an arch).

Now move the arch's `guide brush' into the hole,
and line everything up so that the sides and the top are flush
with the sides of the hole, and the bottom is where you want it.
In a 3d view, things should look as more or less as
shown:

Now, when we select the duplicator itself (which can be done without
opening the tree view by selecting the brush and
<act>RMB | Navigate Tree | Arch | Select</act>), we'll see something like this:

When the duplicator is selected, the tracery of bezier
mesh lines becomes visible.  Also, in an OGL view, the brush itself
takes on a reddish color (this doesn't happen in the other
views).  It is also possible that the textures might be misaligned,
so controlling that is our next topic.

Arches get the textures of their front and back faces
off the front and back faces of their guide brush.  So all
we have to is to tag some face of the wall (assuming the other
wall bits are properly aligned), then select the front face
of the arch's guide brush, and then <act>RMB | Project Texture from Tagged</act>,
and ditto for the back wall.  The results should look more or
less as to the right (the red line is the part of the outline
of the wall-face that the texture was projected from).

If your arch's front or back
textures are misaligned, you should fix them now; if they're not,
mess them up and then fix them.

The inside of the arch is unfortunately not so straightforward.  It
would be nice if there was some way to wrap the texture on the front
or back onto the inside curve, but there isn't, at least without using
specially pre-prepared and proportioned textures.  So we basically
are stuck with a misalignment here, which can be ameliorated
by using some fairly bland, unpatterned texture on the inside
face (there's a further amelioration we'll get to later, after
dealing with the arch/cap duplicator specifics).

<table border=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td valign=top>

But what we can do is get the textures aligned around the inside
of the archway.  The inside curve gets
its texture off the top face of the guide-brush.  So basically
what we want to do is wrap that texture onto the two walls.
However for geometrical reasons we don't want to quite do that.
To set the scene, raise the bottom of the guide-brush to explose
some bare wall-side, then select the top face of the guide-brush
and put a suitable ceiling-texture on it.  The results might look
like this as to the right.

<tr><td valign=top>

Next, tag the top face of  guide brush, then select a wall, as
indicated to the right:

Finally, on the selected face, do <act>RMB|Texture|Wrapping|From tagged mirror</act>.
The texture on the curve ought to now extend
down the wall, smoothly aligned.  Repeat on the other side, and
it's done.

But if you look closely with an patterned texture, you'll see
that the texture scale is compressed somewhat on the curved portion;
that's because its being positioned and scaled on the curve so
that it will join up smoothly with what's on the walls, but
the distance around the flat wall face is longer than on the
smooth curve-face.  This is because of a bit of tricky coding
in the duplicator, whereby the texture scale is compressed
just enough so that the distance in texture-space around
the curve equals the distance, w.r.t the top-face scale, around
the three faces defining the arch.

A final point: for some textures, especially small and/or
non-square ones, this positioning trick doesn't work and the
textures come out strangely warped.  This is a bug I haven't
tracked down yet; to use these texture on inside arches, you
have to check the `stretchtex' box, & you'll have to manage
alignments manually.
