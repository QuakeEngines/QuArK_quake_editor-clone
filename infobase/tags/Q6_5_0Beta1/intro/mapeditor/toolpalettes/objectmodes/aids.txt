<b><u>Visual Aids</u></b>:<br>
Applying to all of the <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html">QuArK Quick Object Makers</a>, a number of visual aids have been added to enhance their features. These are covered below in relation to the screen shot also shown below. As a general statement, all objects shapes and changes are shown during the entire dragging process in all of the 2D and 3D views as redline objects. Once this process is completed they are 'dropped' into these views as full polys, or groups of ploys in their own folder, and with the 'Default' mapping texture applied. In some cases, their sections and/or  faces will be labeled for easy individual identification.

<i>Ruler guide in 2D views:</i> This function has been incorporated to show dimensions as a drag is taking place and upon its completion as well. The 'Rulers' are fully dependent on their normal <a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#optionsmenu">view function controls</a> and can be turned on or off for each individual 2D view as desired.

<i>Starting point marker:</i> At the beginning of each drag a <font color="BLUE">blue target marker</font> is created to designate that position in the 2D dragging view. Because a poly can not be constructed with less than three faces, objects will not be drawn until, holding down the <g>LMB</g>, the cursor has moved at least three vertical scale grid sections away from this target position and either to the left or right of it. For every grid unit the cursor moves away vertically (up or down) from this target an additional section of faces, and in some cases an additional section, will be added to the object. When the cursor is moved horizontally (left or right) from the target the object will increase in size. The reverse also holds true. To keep from creating an object, to change its distortion settings or cancel its creation, simple move within the 'no draw' zone and release the mouse button.

<i>Segment\Face indicator:</i> As a drag takes place a <font color="GREEN">green  label</font> and <font color="GREEN">cross hairs</font> are also displayed and updated to indicate the number of segments (sections) in some cases and faces. As the amounts increase and decrease, the label will change color from <font color="GREEN">green</font> to <font color="FUSHA">fuchsia</font> to <font color="PURPLE">purple</font> to <font color="RED">red</font> indicating a possible program performance slowdown and excessive faces for game use. In the case of the <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html">Sphere object</a>, any amount over fifteen faces, in the <font color="PURPLE">purple</font> to <font color="RED">red</font> range, will cause a program slowdown and possible temporary freezing. However, it will return to finish the object if so desired. Otherwise, just move the cursor back below the <font color="PURPLE">purple</font> zone and continue when it returns active.


<b><u>Misc. Info</u></b>:<br>
A couple of brief extra points on the use of the <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html">QuArK Quick Object Makers</a> are given here, below.

<i>Special vertex dragging</i>:<br>
As mentioned earlier in the <ref> ./pyramid_cone </ref> section above, movement of an objects <g>vertex</g> using the standard method may cause unwanted distortion. If so, try using the special <g>vertex</g> dragging function as described in the <ref> ./pyramid_cone </ref> section.

<i>Grid Scale effects</i>:<br>
Changing the <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.display.html#grid">Grid Scale settings</a> will have a direct effect on both the size of the objects and the scale of their texture, which is always the <a href="intro.configuration.games.specificgames.html">Game Configuration</a> Default texture.

<i>Make Hollow & Other tools</i>:<br>
Even though the automatic hollow function is available for use, as covered in the <ref> ./dialogboxes </ref> section above, you still have the option to use both the <a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#commandsmenu">Extrude walls</a> and <a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#commandsmenu">Make hollow</a> tools on a solid object. It is recommended that these tools be used with a low <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.movement.html">Movement Configuration</a> setting for the <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.movement.html#configuration">Inflate/Deflate</a> amount. Even though the inside shape will be accessible for players and other models, interior walls may still exist. These will need to be removed manually. It is also recommended that you use a negative amount to cause it to build inward thus to help eliminate <g>holes</g> or <g>leaks</g> in the finished product. Even doing so may sometimes still leave <g>gaps</g> of the outer walls, thus causing a <g>leak</g>. In which case it will become necessary to either repair these <g>leaks</g> manually, place another poly over the <g>leaks</g> to close them or place a large hollow box around the entire map area to allow proper building of the map. 
Another good idea is to check for <a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#searchmenu">Broken polys and faces</a> afterwards depending on how they will be used in the map.

One other, and perhaps more consistently successful way, would be to use a <a href="intro.mapeditor.dataforms.html#polyhedronview">negative poly</a> to create a large opening or doorway and leaving the interior walls intact for the most part. But as all good things, this will take a little bit of experimentation and imagination to become proficient at.

<u><i>A word of caution</i></u>: Curved shaped objects use the <a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#commandsmenu">Extrude walls</a> method automatically to make them hollow. This can leave visible separations between their outer faces. Using the <a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#commandsmenu">Make hollow</a> function manually can take an extremely long period of time, well over an hour for the sphere with twenty or more faces, because of the large number of faces that they can consist of for a single poly. During this processing time QuArK will freeze up and appear to be non-responsive. However, it will return active once the hollow object is completed.

<u><i>A Recommended Solution</i></u>: to the above situation would be to create the solid object first, to ensure its proper size and location for its map use. Open another session of QuArK, copy the solid object to the new session and allow the hollowing function to take place there while you continue your work in the original session. Then copy the completed hollow object back into the map for final placement and deletion of the original solid object.

You can determine which method an object has been made hollow with by either looking closely at its outer faces where they join or by looking on the Edit menus <a href="intro.mapeditor.menu.html#editmenu">Undo / Redo...</a> window where the method used will be shown just above the object listing. Clicking on the method listed will return the object to its solid state, in its current position, without having to remake it.
