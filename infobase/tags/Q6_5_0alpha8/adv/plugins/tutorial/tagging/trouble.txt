title: Troubleshooting
author: tiglari

When things start getting a bit complicated, bugs get likely.
Plugins starting with map- get loaded when you start the
map editor, and if they are syntactically ill-formed, the
loading process will stop, leaving you with an error message
on the `console' (dark screen, red letters).  After fixing
the mistake, it is often possible to procede just by closing
the grey window you also get (failed mapeditor window),
and opening the map editor again.  Sometimes this doesn't
work, and you have to restart QuArK.

QuArK is also supposed to show the console when a runtime error
is encountered, but for some reason, this isn't always working
now, and command execution just stops.  You can add `debug'
statements to code, which print things out to the console,
and you can also put QuArK into `developer mode' in the
options menu.  Then `squawk' statements will print out
messageboxes with whatever message you want. e.g.
<code>
    squawk('newface: '+newface.shortname)
</code>

Finally, in developer mode, a `Reload' command will appear on
the command menu; this allows you to reload a module.  This
usually works for plugins (tho not always for quarkpy files),
with some glitches, such as duplication, etc., of menu items.
But it's often quicker than restarting QuArK from scarch.
It can't be made perfect, because Python doesn't have any
`unload' command that could reverse the effects of loading
a module.
