The above works, except that we've lost the disablers.  We could
arrange things so that the RMB items used the same disablers
as the command items, but the actual conditions are a bit
different.  For example on the RMB, the selected item is
guaranteed to be a single face, since we're putting these
items on the face menu.  So we can use much simpler disablers
and revise our menu function to, say, this:
<code>
def tagmenu(o, editor, oldfacemenu = quarkpy.mapentities.FaceType.menu.im_func):
    "the new right-mouse for sides"
    menu = oldfacemenu(o, editor)
    menglueside.state = mentagside.state = mencleartag.state = qmenu.normal
    tagged = gettagged(editor)
    if tagged is None:
        menglueside.state = mencleartag.state = qmenu.disabled
    elif tagged==o:
        mentagside.state = menglueside.state = qmenu.disabled
    menu = [mentagside, menglueside, mencleartag]+menu
    return menu
</code>
<tt>maptagside4.py</tt> contains the final version of this
stuff so far.

Here we're using menu items and click functions defined outside
menu functions, but there is another approach that's possible
if you don't want to also use the menu item on the main menu
or a toolbar.  If we define the click function inside the
menu function, we can use the default argument mechanism
to pass the editor and the face operated on, so that for
example the menu function might start out like this:
<code>
def tagmenu(o, editor, oldfacemenu = quarkpy.mapentities.FaceType.menu.im_func):
    "the new right-mouse for sides"
    menu = oldfacemenu(o, editor)
</code>
<code>
    def tagSideClick(m, face=o, editor=editor):
        editor.tagging = Tagging()
        editor.tagging.tagged = face
        editor.invalidateviews()
</code>
This technique is used in `curvemenu' in plugins\mb2curves.py,
and elsewhere.

A final point is that the disabler calculations are sometimes
quite complex, and produce results that are useful for the
actual operation.  This happens for example with the
texture-wrapping commands in the real maptagside.py.  These
results can be passed thru to the click function either
with the default argument mechanism:
<code>
    usefulInfo = complicatedFunction(o, editor)
</code>
<code>
    def complexClick(m,o=o, editor=editor,usefulInfo=usefulInfo)
        ...
</code>
<code>
    menuItem = qmenu.item('Complicated Function',complexClick)
    if usefulInfo is None:
        menuItem.state=qmenu.disabled
</code>
or else by attaching thing them directly to the menu item:
<code>
    ...
    menuItem = qmenu.item('Complicated Function',complexClick)
    menuItem.usefulInfo = complicatedFunction(o, editor)
    if isefulInfo is None:
        menuItem.state=qmenu.disabled
    else:
        menuitem.usefulInfo=usefulInfo
</code>
If the latter technique is used, the click function can be
defined outside of the menu function definition:
<code>
def compexClick(m):
    editor=madeditor()
    if editor is None: return
    usefulInfo = m.usefulInfo
    ...
</code>
Even tho the click function only gets one (non-default)
argument, the menu item that was clicked on to launch
it, this imposes no practical limitation on the amount
of information that can be passed thru it, since there's
no limit on what can be attached to that argument
