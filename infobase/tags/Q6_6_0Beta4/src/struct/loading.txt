title: Loading files
author: Armin Rigo

Here are comments that will help you in writing support for a new file type.

QuArK has got a complex file management structure, but you need not be aware of it as long as you use the "official" way of
loading and saving files. Doing so will let QuArK handle things such as loading or saving directly inside a .pak file, and
load-on-demand.

To support a new file type, a class inherits from QFileObject and overrides some key methods. The first one is TypeInfo, which
should return the file extension. QuArK recognize files based on their extension only, and then invokes the correct class'
<tt>LoadFile</tt> method. This method must process the file it receive in a parameter and turn *all* information it contains
into Specific/Args and subobjects.

For example, the method <tt>LoadFile</tt> of QMapFile parses the map file and creates the whole hierarchy of groups,
polyhedrons and entities.

Some file types are suitable for load-on-demand, which is implemented through subobjects whose class also has a
<tt>LoadFile</tt> method.
For example, when loading a .PAK file, it is of course not completely loaded into memory : the directory of the file is
processed, and folders and subfolders are created accordingly. The files inside the folders are also created but this time
through the method <tt>LoadedItem</tt>, which may be called from a <tt>LoadFile</tt> method only. It creates a subobject which
is marked as "not loaded yet"; this subobject's own <tt>LoadFile</tt> method will be called when necessary to actually load the
(sub-)file.

In summary, the method <tt>LoadFile</tt> must :

<ul>
<li>load every information contained in the file and store it all as Specific/Args and subobjects, with one exception : calls
    to <tt>LoadedItem</tt>, which does not immediately load the data;
<li>don't do anything else (no direct disk access, no display, etc.), with one exception : calls to LoadSibling, to access
    files besides the one currently loading (typically, Quake 2's models and sprites refer to .pcx files for the model skin and
    sprite images).
</ul>
