title: Delphi for C(++) programmers
author: Tiglari

Delphi is a system built on Object Pascal.  The difference
between O.P. and C++ is mostly syntax, but there are some
substantive matters:

<ul>
<li>case doesn't matter: string = String
<li>@variable gives the address of variable.
<li>The OP class system is based on RTTI, and has inherently
    greater flexibility than C++ (tho a lot less than Python).
<li>Casts are done with what looks like a C++ constructor.
    so if you want to cast a QObject as QFileObject, you write:
    <tt>QFileObject(Obj)</tt> where Obj is your QObject.
<li>OP constructors are by convention called Create, but
    can be called anything.  So MyClass.Create('bozo') would
    probably be a constructor.
<li>A significant innovation is `properties' (basically
    the same thing as `ties' in PERL).  A property is a class
    attribute that looks like an ordinary data member
    externally, but has associated with it <tt>read</tt> and <tt>write</tt>
    methods that are invoked at the appropriate times.
    So something like: <tt>thing.size := 10;</tt>
    can set off an arbitrarily large amount of processing,
    if <tt>size</tt> is a property of <tt>thing</tt>'s class.  Convenient
    for coding, but sometimes deceptive when reading the
    results ...
<li>HORRIBLE GOTCHA:  in an <tt>if begin ... end else ...</tt>
    statement, if you put a semicolon after end, it will
    compile but the else block will never execute.
    [Note by Armin: wrong, a ';' before an 'else' will never compile]
    The semicolon rules are different than in C(++).
    Semicolons suck.
<li>OP doesn't use header files.  The essential work of
    C(++) .h files is done in the <tt>interface</tt> section of
    a module, whereas the work of the .c(pp) files is done
    in the following <tt>implementation</tt> section.  It wouldn't
    be a bad a idea to read the Delphi help on <tt>interface</tt>,
    <tt>implementation</tt> and <tt>initialization</tt>.
<li>Programs, modules, etc end with <tt>end.</tt>  This also sucks.
<li>In spite of the semicolons, in general, as far as I can
    make out, O.P. has everything you need to make real programs,
    without the annoying limitiations of 'textbook Pascal'.
</ul>
