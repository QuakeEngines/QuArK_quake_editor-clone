To explain the idea of the 'Arg Replacer', it is properly best to show an example.

Say you have two <b>func_door</b>s and a <b>trigger_multiple</b> which
should activate the two doors. Normally you would have to assign the same
string to <i>targetname</i> of the two func_doors and in <i>target</i> of the
trigger_multiple. If you then wanted a second copy of those three entities, you
had to go in and change the string of all three specifics again, so the first
trigger_multiple don't activate the second set of func_doors.

With the 'Arg Replacer', you can put each copy of the three entities into an
Arg Replacer object (as shown in the images), and then only in the Arg
Replacer's specific/args change the string. When QuArK then builds the map, the
special constructed value '<b>%</b>name<b>%</b>', will be replaced with the
ones from the Arg Replacer object.

In the image, both func_doors have set some of their specifics to values that
the Arg Replacer should replace when the map is build:

The trigger_multiple also have a specific set, which match the <i>targetname</i> of the func_doors:

In the Arg Replacer, you add new specifics (<u>not</u> surrounded by
<b>%</b> signs) that match the <b>%</b>name<b>%</b> args in the other entities.
The argument is what they will be replaced with.

This is the result that QuArK will produce of the above three entities, that
have their arguments replaced by the Arg Replacer:

Now you can take a second copy of the Arg Replacer, and its childs. But this
time you don't have to change the arguments of the three entities:

<img>argreplacer_5.png</img>

Only the Arg Replacer's arguments have to be changed:

Remember! There is a blue hintbox, when viewing the Arg Replacer's spec/arg
view.
