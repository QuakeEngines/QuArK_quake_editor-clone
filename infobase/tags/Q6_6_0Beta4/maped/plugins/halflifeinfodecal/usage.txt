There are five specifics, in the infodecal helper, which you must know about:
<ul>
<li>text
<li>wildchar
<li>tex_upper
<li>tex_lower
<li>tex_numeric
</ul>

<b>text</b>
will contain the text-string that you want to appear as infodecals, close to the wall.

<b>wildchar</b>
is the character, in the three tex_* specifics, which will be replaced by a letter from your
<i>text</i>, to create one infodecal.

<b>tex_upper</b>
is the uppercase-letters texture/decal-template. It must contain just one
<i>wildchar</i>-character, at the position where one letter at a time, from the
<i>text</i>, will be placed.

<b>tex_lower</b>
is the lowercase-letters texture/decal-template. The same apply for
<i>wildchar</i> as above.

<b>tex_numeric</b>
is the numeric-digits texture/decal-template. The same apply for
<i>wildchar</i> as above.

The texture/decal-templates must be something like this:

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
  <tr><th>Specific    </th><th>Arg        </th><th>which will expand to                 </th></tr>
  <tr><td>tex_upper   </td><td>{CAPS@     </td><td>{CAPSA {CAPSB {CAPSC etc.            </td></tr>
  <tr><td>tex_lower   </td><td>{LOWCHAR@  </td><td>{LOWCHARA {LOWCHARB {LOWCHARC etc.   </td></tr>
  <tr><td>tex_numeric </td><td>{NUM@SMALL </td><td>{NUM0SMALL {NUM1SMALL {NUM2SMALL etc.</td></tr>
</table></center>

In QuArK's specific/arg-view, you will be able to push a button, to select a texture/decal name,
but you must remember to put in the
<i>wildchar</i>, otherwise the Half-Life Infodecal Helper won't be able to assign the
correct texture/decal to the infodecal entity.
