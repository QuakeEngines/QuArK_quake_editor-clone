<I><u>Quick torus maker</u></I>:  After you click this button, you can draw a torus group on the map with the left mouse button and each torus will be turned into a group of polys.

Move the mouse forward to add more faces, backwards for fewer faces, right to make it larger and left to make it smaller.<br>NOTE: Less than 3 faces will not draw anything. Because a torus is made up of a number of <g>convex</g> <g>polys</g> they will be placed into a group folder.

This particular object maker has its own <a href="intro.mapeditor.toolpalettes.objectmodes.html#dialogboxes">Dialog Input Box</a> because of the many different shapes that can be obtained when using a torus object.
