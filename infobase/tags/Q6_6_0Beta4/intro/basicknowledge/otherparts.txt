title: Other parts of QuArK (incl. textures, prefabs and templates)
author: Armin Rigo / Decker / cdunde

The other parts of QuArK lack documentation. The general way QuArK works -- besides the map editor -- is by displaying files
in windows with trees that describe the structure of the file. This lets you easily edit e.g. <tt>.PAK</tt> files.
The texture browser, too, has a tree at its left, and the "New Map Items" window is itself a big tree. You work with trees a
bit like you do with the Windows Explorer: Use the mouse to drag and drop or copy and paste anything, and use the right button
while clicking or while dragging to get a pop-up menu. There are also commands in the menus to make new folders, etc.

If you want to make changes in a tree -- e.g. make your custom textures or add new map items or prefabs -- you should first
create a new "main folder" with the corresponding item in the "Folders" menu. This command will let you specify in which file
this new main folder should be stored. You can then add stuff with the copy and paste, with drag and drop, or with the buttons
at the top of the window, like "new sub-folder", "new texture list", "new texture", etc.


<ul>
<li><strong>Example 1: creating new textures.</strong><br>
  In the texture browser, select "Folders", "New Main Folder". Choose the option that best suits your needs, then
  click Ok. Then click on the new folder called "New Folder" (you can rename it if you like by single-clicking on its
  name, as usual). Click on the button "new texture list" at the top. This create a sub-folder where you can store
  textures. Use the above buttons "new texture" to create new textures. These buttons create sub-objects in the
  folder, that is, they create an initially black texture. You should first rename it, and then you can edit it by
  clicking on the button "call external editor". Note that all these buttons at the top only appear when you select
  the corresponding object in the tree.

<li><strong>Example 2: making prefabs.</strong><br>
  Same procedure as above but in the New Map Items window. To organize the prefabs in sub-folders, use the command
  "New sub-folder" in the "Folders" menu. Use copy and paste from the map editor. Also note that map prefabs can also
  be drag-and-dropped directly on the panel at the left in the map editor, where there are already a cube and a light
  by default.

<li><strong>Example 3: making & using templates.</strong><br>
  Templates are somewhat like prefabs but far more powerful. There is also a specific setting for selecting a Templates
  folder for each game that QuArK supports in the Games Configuration section of every game. For a complete
  understanding of templates please see its own section in <ref> intro/mapeditor/misctools/templates \ Misc tools </ref>.

</ul>

All your changes are saved in the file you specified in "New Main Folder". This is an "add-on" file that you can pass to
your friends, if you like. Your friends must use the "Games" menu, "Add-ons", in QuArK's main window, to use your add-on.
