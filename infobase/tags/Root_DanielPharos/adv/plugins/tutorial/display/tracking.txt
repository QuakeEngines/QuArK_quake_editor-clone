title: Tracking the tagged face
author: tiglari

But there is still a problem.  Tag a face, and then move it.  The blue
line will probably stay behind in its original position.  And if you
use the Glue to Tagged command, you'll see the glued side snapping
to the original position of the the moved face, not the present
position.  These aren't really show-stopping bugs, but it's still
goofy behavior.    What's going on is that
the editor's tagging.tagged attribute is storing the old face, while
the effect of the movement was to subsitute a new one; QuArK doesn't
do a very good job of keeping track of identity of map objects as we
tend to construe it.

What we want to do is check that the tagged object is still in
the map, before doing things that depend on its being there.
For this we first utility function `checktree', defined in
quarkpy.maputils.py, which tests whether one object is
inside another.
What we want to do is, at some strategic point, make sure that
the tagged face (the thing sitting in editor.tagging.tagged)
is still sitting in the map structure (inside editor.Root).
We can do this with a little function `checktagged', defined
inside of tagfinishdrawing, right after we've gotten the tagged
face, which we then check the value of before proceeding:
<code>
    ...
    tagged = gettagged(editor)
    if tagged is None: return
</code>
<code>
    def checktagged(tagged=tagged, editor=editor):
        if not checktree(editor.Root, tagged):
            cleartag(editor)
            return 0
        return 1
</code>
<code>
    if tagged is None or not checktagged():
        return
    ...
</code>
This function utilizes the extremely useful technique of `default
arguments, in the definition of the function, the variables to
the right of the equalities in the function's argument-list
are evaluated in the context where
the function is defined, and then used as the values of the
variables on the left in subsequent calls.  Here the usage
of this technique is trivial,
just making an `if' statement a bit shorter, but things can get
more serious.  It would also seem to be a good idea to get rid
of the tagging attribute when it's useless; this is accomplished
by the `cleartag' function that's invoked above and defined here:
<code>
def cleartag(editor):
    try:
       del editor.tagging
    except (AttributeError):
       pass
</code>
Now as a pleasant side effect of all this,
when we move the tagged side, the Glue item should become
disabled on the menu.

Finally, as an easy exercise, you should implement a `Clear tag"
command.  Sample final results in <tt>maptagside3.py</tt>.
