title: Brush Primitives
author: tiglari

'Brush primitives' is the new brush format used by GtkRadiant.
Other than some extra braces and a 'Brushdef' in the text of the format,
its main new feature (for now at any rate) is an improved method of
expressing the texture-mapping over the 5 'shift scale rotate'
numbers that come after the texture name in the old
representation.

In BP format, you get something that looks like this coming
after the threeponts info, and before the texture name:
<code>
( ( 0.007813 0 0 ) ( 0 0.007813 0 ) )
</code>
What these are is the top two rows of the 'homogeneous matrix'
mapping the plane of the face, under a special coordinate system
we will get to in a moment, into the texture plane (so it's sort
of the reverse of how QuArK etp and tv6 work, since these most directly
represent the mapping from the texture plane onto the face).
Erm, what's a homogeneous matrix you might ask.

It is 3x3 matrix whose bottom row is (0 0 1).  If you multiply
a homogeneous matrix by a column vector whose z coordinate is
1, 
you'll see that the equations are exactly those for a
linear mapping followed by a translation: the first two numbers
of the top two rows give a 2x2 matrix describing the linear
transformation, and the last number give a column vector to
be added (to the a column 2-vector) to give the translation.
So what about this coordinate system?

It is one whose axis directions are gotten by rotating the
Y and Z coordinates of map space so that they lie in the
plane.  These direction vectors are computed by function
GetAxisBase in QkMapPoly.pas.  It's essential that q3map
and the editor compute them in the same way; hopefully the
GtkRadiant/Q3map developers won't change it without telling us.
Then of course for a coordinate system you need an origin,
this is gotten by scaling the face's normal vector by its
Dist (-ance from the origin).

So what goes on in GetPXPY is that the (texture-scaled,
etc.) threepoints are converted to the Axis Base coordinate
system, and then these equations are solved for the
coefficients aij making up the matrix (I used Maple V
to get the solution):
<code>
 a11*p0x+a12*p0y+a13 =  0
 a21*p0x+a22*p0y+a23 =  0

 a11*p1x+a12*p1y+a13 =  1
 a21*p1x+a22*p1y+a23 =  0

 a11*p2x+a12*p2y+a13 =  0
 a21*p2x+a22*p2y+a23 = -1
</code>

The conversions from Brush Primitives to QuArK (once etp, now tv6) are
made in the procedure ReadQ3BrushDef in QkMap.pas.
