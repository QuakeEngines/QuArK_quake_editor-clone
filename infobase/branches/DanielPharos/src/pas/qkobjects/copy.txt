title: Copying
author: Tiglari / Armin

Sometimes an object is not loaded yet when it needs to be saved on disk,
typically when you make only a few changes to a complex .QRK or .PAK file. Then
instead of loading the object with all its sub-objects, which takes time and
consumes memory, we make a binary copy of the part of the original file into
the destination file. This is what <tt>Copying</tt> tries to do. It returns
False if the object was already loaded, meaning that direct copying is not
possible. If <tt>TransfertSource</tt> is <tt>True</tt>, the object's FNode is
updated so that if it needs to be loaded later in memory, it will be read from
the copy instead. This lets the original file be closed, which is necessary in
case we are overriting it (which is the case each time we do a normal 'Save').
