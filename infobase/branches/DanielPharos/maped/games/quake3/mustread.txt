title: A MUST READ for all Quake-3: Arena map-designers
author: Decker

If you plan on making maps for Quake-3: Arena, it should be almost mandatory to read the Q3Radiant manual written by Paul
Jaquays of id Software.

Yes you read it correct, I did write "the Q3Radiant manual". It contains very good hints and tips, that a map-designer
should know, or at least would want to, before falling into the utter frustration when something just won't work.

The manual should be available from
<a href="http://www.qeradiant.com">www.qeradiant.com</a>,
or other well assorted Quake-3: Arena/Q3Radiant editing sites.
